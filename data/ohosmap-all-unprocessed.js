Roedd yn offeiriad plwyf yn Hanford West a byddai&rsquo;n ymweld â&rsquo;i deulu yn Abertawe yn rheolaidd. Byddai&rsquo;n galw yn yr henaduriaeth yn Hwlffordd. Roedd Canon Shwartz a Tad Darmody yno a dyna pryd y cyfarfyddais ag ef gyntaf. Roeddem ein dau tua&rsquo;r un oed a daethom yn ffrindiau. Byddai&rsquo;n galw am sgwrs yn rheolaidd ar ei ffordd i Llanelli a hynny yn hwyr y nos. Bu&rsquo;n gurad yn Llanelli am bum mlynedd a byddem yn cyfarfod yn amal a mynd allan am brydau bwyd gyda&rsquo;n gilydd.</p><p>00:01:37 SB: Beth fyddech chi&rsquo;n dweud oedd eich argraff o&rsquo;r ohono?</p><p>&nbsp;00:01:42- 02:44 OM: Dyn cymdeithasgar a chyfeillgar, hawdd iawn i gyfathrebu ag o. Roedd yn ddoniol, yn gellweirus ac yn llawn hwyl. Roedd diddordeb ganddo mewn pobol a&rsquo;u lles, nid fel y disgwyliech i offeiriad fod. Roedd yn ymddiddori yn arbennig yn lles pobol anffortunus y byd yma ac &lsquo;roedd tosturi a chydymdeimlad ganddo tuag atynt. Er ei fod ef ei hun o dras dosbarth canol, helpu pobol llai ffortunus oedd ei ddiddordeb pennaf.</p><p>00:02:55- 03:04 SB: Cyn inni ddechrau ricordio roeddech yn sôn wrthym am eich hoff hanesion am Tad Sartori. Fyddech chi cystal a&rsquo;u hailadrodd ar gyfer y ricordiad os gwelwch yn dda?</p><p>00:03:06 - 5:23 OM: Gallaf wrth gwrs &ndash; rhai o&rsquo;m hoff hanesion amdano. Gwynebodd ei waeledd angheuol yn hollol bositif a threuliodd dri mis yn Ysbyty Singleton a Sancta Maria. Chollodd o mo&rsquo;i synnwyr digrifwch a chofiaf fel y byddai&rsquo;n sôn wrthym am y digwyddiadau rhyfedd. Un o&rsquo;r rhain oedd pan oedd Esgob Fox ag yntau wedi bod yn ymweld â&rsquo;r cleifion yn y plwyf. &ldquo;Diolch i Dduw, Paul bod hynna drosodd&rdquo; meddai&rsquo;r esgob. &ldquo;Ond rhaid ichi ymweld â&rsquo;r Clwb Llafur&rdquo; atebodd Paul. &ldquo;O felly, oes raid imi? meddai&rsquo;r esgob. Atebodd Paul &ldquo;Oes, am fy mod wedi betio &pound;10 y buaswn yn mynd â chi yno.&rdquo; Wel, ichi fe aeth Esgob Fox i&rsquo;r Clwb Llafur yn ei holl lifrai ac yfed peint hefo&rsquo;r dynion oedd yno. Stori arall&hellip;</p><p>00:05:23 SB Y stori garddio?</p><p>00:05:24-00:07:29 OM: Fel y gwyddoch, roedd gan Paul ddiddordeb mawr yn y difreintiedig a byddai&rsquo;r rhain yn dwad at ddrws yr henaduriaeth. Gwyddom oll fod hyn yn digwydd &ndash; dyma eu noddfa derfynol a disgwylient i&rsquo;r offeiriaid I roi cymortgh iddynt. Daeth bachan at y drws a stori fawr fod ei ewythr yn Iwerddon wedi marw ac roedd eisiau arian arno i dalu i fynd i&rsquo;r Iwerddon ar y fferi o Abergwaun. Rhoddodd Paul swm sylweddol iddo ac i ffwrdd ag o. Nes ymlaen, aeth Paul i&rsquo;r Clwb Llafur yn ôl ei arfer a phwy oedd yno ond y bachan oedd wedi rhoi yr arian iddo, yn hollol feddw. Aeth Paul o&rsquo;i gô&rsquo; yn gandryll a rhaid oedd ei atal rhag ymosod ar y meddwyn. &ldquo;A dyma&rsquo;r arian oedd i dalu&rsquo;r fferi i&rsquo;r Iwerddon, ie? Yfed yn y prynhawn.&rdquo; Dyna&rsquo;r math o hanes wyddoch ond fuasai hyn ddim yn ei atal rhag helpu.</p><p>00:07:30 SB: Roeddech yn sôn fel y bu lladrad yn yr henaduriaeth ac i Paul amddiffyn y lleidr gerbron y llys &ndash;</p><p>00:07:35-00:09:18 OM: Dyna chi enghraifft arall fel yr oedd calon fawr gen Paul. Torri mewn i&rsquo;r henaduriaeth wnaeth bachan gan luchio dillad allan trwy&rsquo;r ffenestr. Galwyd yr heddlu a bu&rsquo;r bachan o flaen ei well yn y llys ynadon. Bu Paul yno lawer iawn yn amddiffyn pobol a haerodd y tro hwn bod mwy o angen am yr eitemau gan y lleidr. Roedd hanesion o&rsquo;r fath yn dangos ei ddynoliaeth, ei ymdeimlad i allu darganfod anghenion pobol a&rsquo;u cefndiroedd allai fod yn gyfrifol am eu hymddygiad.</p><p>00:09:19 SB: A chefndir hollol wahanol i&rsquo;w gefndir ef ei hunan.</p><p>00:09:21-00:10:37 OM: Er ei fagwraeth dosbarth canol, roedd ganddo ymwybyddiaeth enfawr o anghenion y rhai anffortunus a difreintiedig. Ei flaenoriaeth oedd y cleifion ac o hyn death ei syniad o sefydlu hosbis. Sylweddolodd mai prin iawn oedd gofal hosbis a&rsquo;i syniad oedd y dylai fod un. Credaf i&rsquo;r syniad ddatblygu allan o salwch Mrs Dursley. Doedd unlle iddi fynd. Daeth Paul i gredu y dylai fod lle i gleifion fynd iddo ac nid oedd unlle yn lleol wyddoch.</p><p>00:10:38 SB: Ac fel y dywedsoch, bu haelioni ei fodryb yn Jersey yn symbylu ei ddiddordeb.</p><p>00:10:48 - 00:11:00 OM: Ie, yn sicir, ei fwriad oedd hosbis preswyl.</p><p>00:11:01 SB: Ie</p><p>00:11:02-00:12:27 OM: Roedd eisiau adeilad mawr a bu&rsquo;n edrych ar adeiladau yn Hwlffordd a&rsquo;r cylch. Pan ymwelais ag o pan oedd yn sâl, byddai&rsquo;n sôn mwy am yr hosbis nac am ei ddyfodol ysbrydol ei hunan. Gobeithiai y byddai&rsquo;r prosiect yn parhau ar ôl iddo farw. Yn ddiweddarach, penderfynodd y pwyllgor am sefydlu Hosbis yn y Cartref. Beth tybed fyddai ei ran ef pe bai Duw wedi ei helpu? Byddai&rsquo;n sicir wedi cytuno â&rsquo;r prosiect ac wedi derbyn cyngor yr esgob fel y bu imi ei wneud.</p><p>00:12:28 SB: Ac ynglŷn â hynny, gadawsoch y pwyllgor gwreiddiol a bod yr esgob wedi penderfynu&hellip;</p><p>00:12:35 - 00:15:45 OM: Ie yn hollol. Bu Michael Burke, Russ a Mike Stalbo ac eraill yn trafod parhau etifeddiaeth Paul a minnau&rsquo;n cyfathrebu hefo&rsquo;r esgob gan ei fod yn ymwneud â&rsquo;r plwyf. Trafod oeddem ond heb greu dim. Roedd angen caniatâd yr esgob arnom ac fe gawsom gyfarfod ag o. Credai&rsquo;r esgob bod y syniad yn wych ond nad oedd i fod yn rhywbeth Catholigaidd. Roedd y prosiect yn llawer rhy fawr i&rsquo;w hymgymryd yn y plwyf. Credai&rsquo;r esgob na ddylwn fod yn aelod o&rsquo;r pwyllgor a bu&rsquo;n cefnogi ac annogi&rsquo;r gweithwyr. Fe sefydlwyd y pwyllgor swyddogol. Doeddwn i ddim yn rhan ohono. Roedd llawer yno gan gynnwys Canon Harvey oedd yn gyfaill mawr hefo Paul Sartori. Wrth gwrs, rwyf yn adnabod rhai o aelodau&rsquo;r pwyllgor. Fe ddechreuwyd sefydlu&rsquo;r hosbis a chael statws elusennol ar fyrder. Rwyf yn sicir y byddai Paul wedi cytuno â hynny a&rsquo;r esgob hefyd. 00:15:46 SB: Allech chi ail-adrodd wrthym am yr amser pan oedd Paul yn Ysbyty Withybush a&rsquo;r esgob wedi derbyn y newydd bod diagnosis salwch Paul yn angheuol a bod yn rhaid rhoi gwybod iddo.</p><p>00:15:58- 00:22:29 OM: Ar y dechrau, roedd Paul yn Withybush a bu&rsquo;r arbennigwyr yn egluro&rsquo;r driniaeth i&rsquo;r esgob a canon Sheamus Kanan. Roedd cyflwr Paul yn ddifrifol iawn a byddai angen gofal lleddfol arno. Doedd pethau ddim yn hawdd i&rsquo;r un ohonynt ac er bod Sheamus yn ffrindiau mawr hefo Paul, rhaid oedd iddo roi&rsquo;r newydd trist i&rsquo;w gyfaill. Yn ôl Sheamus, derbyniodd Paul y newydd heb lawer o emosiwn a&rsquo;i fod angen hanner awr i feddwl am y peth. Pan ddychwelodd Sheamus, roedd Paul mewn tymer wahanol iawn. &ldquo;Os yw Duw fy eisiau&rdquo; meddai &ldquo;gallaf dderbyn y peth ond rhaid iddo fod yn barod am frwydr. Nid wyf am eistedd o dan hwn ac rwyf eisiau&rsquo;r triniaethau i gyd bob un.&rdquo; Credaf imi grybwyll dau beth &ndash; grym gweddi a gweddïau&rsquo;r plwyf. Gall Duw a gweddïau newid pethau. Aeth Paul i Ysbyty Singleton ac mor belled ag y gwn i, yn ei flaen i Sancta Maria. Dyna fel yr oedd bob amser. Dioddefodd driniaethau lawer yn enwedig yn ysbyty Singleton. Ymwelais ag ef yn amal. Oedd, roedd croes feichus arno ond roedd yn dygymod â hi. Mae hanes arall pan oeddwn yn ymweld ag ef yn yr ysbyty. Roedd ei deulu yno ar y pryd a gofynnodd imi ei weld ar ben ei hun wedi iddynt ymadael. &ldquo;Mae yna faterion y dylem eu trafod gan ymhen yr wythnos, gallwn fod yn &lsquo;doolally&rsquo; ac yn methu siarad â neb. Felly, byddai&rsquo;n syniad da inni eu trafod rwan.&rdquo; Buom yn trafod lawer iawn ac nid wyf am ymhelaethu y materion personol ond gallaf ddweud am ei esgeulustod llwyr mewn llyfrifeg. Roedd am imi gywiro a chyfoesi trosto. Roedd y sgwrs yn emosiynol ac yn ormod imi fel y torrais i lawr. &ldquo;Aros, ngwas i, aros. Fi sy&rsquo;n marw, dim ti.&rdquo; Dyna&rsquo;r math o berson ydoedd a deuthum yn ataf fy hun. Fe gofiaf am hyn am byth. Rhaid imi bwysleisio fel yr oedd Paul yn esiampl aruthrol sut i ddygymod â salwch angheuol a hynny heb roi fyny.</p><p>00:22:29 SB: Ie, dyna ochor iddo na fyddai ei blwyfolion a&rsquo;r bobol ddaeth i&rsquo;w weld yn ei adnabod. Mae&rsquo;n bwysig felly i ricordio hynny &ndash;</p><p>00:22:33 OM: Ydi, yn bwysig iawn.</p><p>00:22:49 SB: Anodd i chi ateb y cwestiwn nesaf yma a chithau wedi dweud cymaint amdano ond dyma fo &ndash; pa dri gair fyddech chi&rsquo;n crynhoi Paul Satrori</p><p>00:23:02 OM: Allwn i ddim dweud rhagor ond hoffwn bwysleisio ei fod yn boblogaidd, yn gyfeillgar a chymdeithasgar. Dyn y bobol ydoedd. Roedd bywyd Paul yn ysbrydol a duwiol ac er nad oedd o yn credu ei fod yn ymgysegru rhan fawr o&rsquo;i fywyd i&rsquo;r ysbrydol, credaf y byddai. Dywedai llawer o bobol y byddai&rsquo;n berson hollol wahanol pan oedd yn cymryd yr offeren i&rsquo;r hyn ydoedd y tu allan i&rsquo;r eglwys. Sylwodd pobol mor wahanol ydoedd pan oedd yn ei ddillad offeiriad wrth yr allor. Byddai&rsquo;n gweddïo ac yn sicir roedd ganddo fywyd ysbrydol dwfn. Offeiriad ydoedd, dim byd arall. Mor belled ag y gwelaf, roedd ei ragoriaethau ar ddau lefel. Roedd yn offeiriad ysbrydol ac hefyd yn weinidog, yn berson tosturiol a llawn gofal.</p><p>00:24:52 SB: O dan y cyfan, mae sylfaen.</p><p>00:24:56 OM: Yn hollol. Does dim amheuaeth iddo symud oddi wrth y ddelwedd o&rsquo;r hyn y dylai offeiriad fod. Roedd yr hen syniad am offeiriad y gysegrfa yn traddodi&rsquo;r offeren ac adrodd y gweddïau ymhell o weledigaeth Paul. Pan ddywedir mai gweledigaeth yr hosbis ydyw gofalu am bobol gyffredin a&rsquo;u anghenion mewn argyfwng gofidus ar ddiwedd eu bywydau, dyna oedd gweledigaeth Paul a&rsquo;r hyn y dylai offeiriad ei wneud.</p><p>00:25:51 SB: Fe ddywedsoch fod pobol o bob enwad yn gofyn i Paul eu helpu i drefnu angladdau.</p><p>00:25:56 &ndash; 27:12 OM: Ie, yn sicir. Byddai pobol eisiau iddo eu helpu i drefnu gwasanaethau crefyddol er nad oedd ganddynt ymroddiad i gapel nac eglwys. Daethent i wybod y byddai Paul yn eu helpu ac fe wnai hynny yn aml, yn enwedig yn yr amlosgfa. Doedd hynny ddim yn broblem gan yr eglwys &ndash; byddaf yn gwneud yr un peth fy hunan. Credai Paul y dylai pobol gael gwasanaeth crefyddol os oeddent yn dymuno hynny ac roedd o yn barod i ymgymeryd â hyn. A&rsquo;r rheswm oedd ei fod yn eu adnabod.</p><p>00:27:13 SB: Dyna oeddwn yn ei ddweud. Nid offeiriad y gysegrfa yn unig oedd Paul ond allan ymysg y bobol fyddai fel mae pobol yn dweud heddiw.

By the end of the 19th century it featured brass bands leading a procession through the town with each church displaying their own banner.\nThe Jubilee remains little changed today. For over 160 years it has taken place on the second Tuesday in July.  Sunday schools from churches and chapels in the Buckley area come together to take part in a procession through the town led by the Royal Buckley Town Band. This film demonstrates the strength of faith and community spirit which still thrives in Buckley to this day.\nThe annual procession begins with a short service held on the Higher Common during which the Jubilee hymn, written by Reverend E. Wyn Parry for the centenary in 1956, is sung accompanied by the Royal Buckley Town Band. After the procession ends, the children are treated to tea and games back at their own Sunday school.\nThis film of the procession taken in Buckley town centre was recorded by David Markey who at the time was manager of a shop in Brunswick Road. Full copyright permission to reproduce the footage here has kindly been granted to the Buckley Society.\nThe date of this event was Tuesday the 11th July 1989. In addition to the Royal Buckley Town Band, it features a visiting band from Červený Kostelec, a town in the Czech Republic.\nAs well as capturing images of the various Church members participating, the film also contains glimpses of shop fronts, local characters, fashions from the era and vehicles of yesteryear. The children filmed will now be adults and many adults filmed will now have, sadly, departed.\nBecause of the Corona Virus outbreak in 2020 and restrictions on public gatherings, it is believed that this year will be the first time in the town’s history that the Jubilee has had to be cancelled.  It is fitting therefore to post this vintage footage now, in the hope that it goes some way to raise spirits in these troubled times.\nWe are very grateful to Mr John Butler for his kind support, skills and assistance in processing this footage and enabling it to be freely available online.\nPaul Davies, Secretary The Buckley Society     www.buckleysociety.org.uk    May 2020\n                      Original VHS tape capture: David Markey\n                        Archive Project Direction: Paul Davies p.p.

In the clip, Colin describes how he changed his name to join X Troop.\n&lt;strong&gt;Colin Edward Anson – a short biography.&lt;/strong&gt;\nColin Edward Anson was born Claus Leopold Octavio Ascher in Berlin in 1922. His father was arrested by the Nazis and died in the Dachau concentration camp in 1937. Colin fled to Britain on the Kindertransport in February 1939. He avoided internment and joined the Pioneer Corps, before being transferred to X Troop. He was badly injured serving in Sicily in 1943. Following a brain operation, he re-joined his unit and fought in Yugoslavia and Italy. After the war, he worked in Germany during the denazification process. He married fellow refugee Alice Gross and worked for various travel companies in London. He died in 2016.\n&lt;strong&gt;Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;\nMy name was a bit of a difficulty because there were various other people whose name began with ‘A’ and there was a tendency to pick a name in which both your surname and your Christian name would have the same initials—in case of embroidered handkerchiefs or what have you—and Andrews and Anderson, all the obvious ‘As’ had already gone. But at that moment, an Avro Anson happened to fly overhead, and it struck me as a very short and agreeable name, and a not very common name, so at that moment I became Anson, and the Claus in my original name became Colin. The middle name of Edward is purely on the spur of the moment, because Captain Hilton-Jones looked up and said, “No middle name? It’s usual to have a middle name.” So, I simply picked that out of fresh air, and that is how Claus Leopold Octavio Ascher was made into Colin Edward Anson.\n&lt;strong&gt;Sources.&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80011624&quot;&gt;Imperial&quot;&gt;https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80011624&quot;&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;\">https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80011624&quot;&gt;Imperia...</a> War Museum, Oral history interview with Colin Edward Anson, 11 February 1991&lt;/a&gt;  [accessed 20 July 2022]\n&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-colin-and-alice-anson-1471868&quot;&gt;The&quot;&gt;https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-colin-and-alice-anson-1471868&quot;&gt;The&lt;/a&gt;\">https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-colin-and-alice-anson-1471868&quo...</a> Newsroom, ‘Obituary: Colin and Alice Anson’, in The Scotsman, 19 July 2016&lt;/a&gt;  [accessed 15 August 2022]\nDepository: Imperial War Museums.","summary":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Colin Edward Anson: changing his name in order to join X Troop, 11 February 1991","title":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Colin Edward Anson: changing his name in order to join X Troop, 11 February 1991","titleCy":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Colin Edward Anson: changing his name in order to join X Troop, 11 February 1991","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1896801","uuid":"cf3d61c5-90c4-378e-a15b-580ba9c3ee42","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1896801.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.046218434759","lat":"52.544023985597","subject":["'OTHER: Religion and Beliefs'","'OTHER: War","'Religious communities'","'Second World War (1939-45)'","'Soldiers'","'Warfare'","Protest and Politics'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Atgofion Malcolm Thomas o drychineb Aberfan a beth mae'n cofio o beth welodd ar y teledu a'r cyfryngau.Mae'n cofio clywed y newyddion am Aberfan ar y radio, ond bod gweld y delweddau ar y teledu yn waeth byth.","summary":"Aberfan -

I was born in 1932 and I'm a farmer by profession. I joined the YFC in, I think, 1951. It was about the only thing that we could join, living in the country. I be living about 4 miles by road from Llangurig, where the Young Farmer's Club was.  And in those days it was either walking, bicycle or a tractor. I can recall many times in the winter, my friend who was on the next farm. We had a Ferguson tractor, no lights, no cab, and he held a torch and we just drove and parked by the main road, by the river. Main reason for that being, that if it was frosty weather, we had to drain the water out and refill again on the way back.  Being a member of the YFC was a great experience, a movement to who I am greatly indebted.  We learnt a lot and it made a great impact on the area such as Llangurig. The young farmer's movement at one time was considered a good marriage bureau. It was once said of Llangurig and I think it was very true, that all they needed really was a permanent registrar and that's where a lot of us found our wives and indeed I was one of those that married a local girl through contact to the YFC.\n\n\tEvacuees came to this area from Liverpool and Birkenhead and they would come by train from Birkenhead or Liverpool to the station here in Llanidloes.  Some of these children remained in the area for a considerable period. Some of them even didn't go back and I often think what a wrench it was, you know, coming from city life to a very rural area. No mod cons. Most of them on farms and the language.  In this area then, the majority of the farming community were Welsh speaking and they went to Welsh homes and they soon picked up the language.  And some of them became virtually fluent in the language before they went back.\n\n\tI attended a very local school. I think we were at the most about 30 at the most in school. Two-teacher school, two classrooms. No modern canteens in those days. We took our lunch with us in our satchels and then in the very late 40's the canteens came, which was a great luxury then. The school was a central point to a community then. We depended so much on the schools where you had a head teacher and possibly a teacher to be sort of leaders in the community and they made a valid contribution. They set up drama groups and became attached to the chapels and it was an age that we made our own entertainment, we had no TV.Elections were big things in those days. I was old enough that I realised in 1945 what an election was and every candidate came to every hamlet and village and crowds got there and it was a thing that you looked forward to.\n\n\tFarmers went through a very very lean time in the 1930s and then later on in the 30s and early 40s they bought these hill farms and eventually they planted them with sucrose and larch and of course, what was left was barely a few fields. People had to move out. Houses became derelict. We lost a lot of the rural population. Though the forestry did provide a lot of local labour at that particular time, but as time got on, and mechanisation and machines came in and private contractors from away and staff came down to virtually nothing. It had a drastic effect on agriculture.","summary":"Farming Life","title":"Ffermio","titleCy":"Ffermio","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/27613","uuid":"50a98fe9-fda7-302f-8fc0-ca383a06b8c8","creationDate":"00201001-08999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-27613.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.600000000000","lat":"52.400000000000","subject":["Clubs","Evacuees","Farmers","farming","yfc"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: Sian Jones yn sn am bapur wal blodeuog","summary":"Sian Jones recalls floral print wallpaper [Welsh]","title":"Sian Jones yn sn am bapur wal blodeuog","titleCy":"Sian Jones yn sn am bapur wal blodeuog","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/39076","uuid":"7db4776f-d293-3395-bb4a-82b75666e6be","creationDate":"00201102-05999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-39076.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.233645000000","lat":"52.919565000000"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: Stuart Davies yn cofio derbyn arian poced am y tro cyntaf [Saesneg]","summary":"Stuart Davies recalls receiving pocket money for the first time","title":"Stuart Davies yn cofio derbyn arian poced am y tro cyntaf [Saesneg]","titleCy":"Stuart Davies yn cofio derbyn arian poced am y tro cyntaf [Saesneg]","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/38016","uuid":"1bd26cea-a8b3-3383-b597-c4e80cddbc45","creationDate":"00201011-19999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-38016.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.952365100000","lat":"51.639634000000","subject":["1950s","English oral history","Manselton","SWANSEA","Stuart Davies","first time","pocket money"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Merch a gafodd pob cyfle er i'w thad golli ei waith yn y chwarel.Mae'r stori ddigidol hon ar gael yn Gymraeg a Saesneg.

In the clip, Julius discusses his experience of religious life as a Jewish refugee in 1939-39.\n\n<strong>Julius Weil – a short biography.</strong>\n\nJulius Weil was born in Dortmund, Germany on 11 October 1925. He lived in Köln with his parents and younger brother Arnold until 1938; on 9-10 November that year, his school was destroyed in the Kristallnacht pogrom. Julius’ headmaster successfully organised to get the whole school transferred to London. Julius was on the first Kindertransport train to leave the country. He never saw his parents or brother again. Julius and his school colleagues were initially sent to Cricklewood, London. With the outbreak of war, Julius was sent to Bedford, where he was billeted with a non-Jewish family. After leaving school at the age of 15, Julius went to work for the Ministry of Supply in its catering division, first in Bedford then in Egham, Surrey. He left the Ministry at the end of the war and worked in a factory in Staines, Surrey. In 1956, Julius joined the Standard Box and Carton company, in Pentrebach, near Merthyr Tydfil. He spent the rest of his working life with the company, eventually becoming a director. \n\nJulius initially attended Orthodox synagogues in Merthyr Tydfil and Cardiff, but moved to the Reform Synagogue in 1968, at the time of his first marriage. \n\nJulius Weil died in February 2021. \n\n<strong>Transcript</strong>\n\nWell, it for, for, for, for the majority—I mean we were, we weren’t, not all the boys were Orthodox so to speak. [Pause.] And, although in the hostel everything was very Orthodox, not only, not only food wise, but also in every, every in life; there were prayers in the morning, there were prayers in the evening, there were prayers after meals. Saying grace after meals. But not all the boys were brought up in that way really. But one thing which was important of course was—you know what kosher is?\n\nKosher food? Which is important or was important. And, [pause] it was strange for anyone who was used to having everything kosher, to be in a non-Jewish home and not being able to partake. [Here, Julius is talking about when he was billeted with a non-Jewish family in Bedford.]\n\nBut the, the people who sponsored us, which were the communities I mentioned before, arranged to have food, kosher food sent down. \n\n<strong>Source</strong>.\n\nJewish History Association of South Wales/Cymdeithas Hanes Iddewig De Cymru (JHASW/CHIDC), Oral history interview with Julius Weil (21 November 2018). \n\nDepository: Screen & Sound Archive, The National Library of Wales.","summary":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Julius Weil talking about religious observance and kosher food, London and Bedford, 1938-39","title":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Julius Weil talking about religious observance and kosher food, London and Bedford, 1938-39","titleCy":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Julius Weil talking about religious observance and kosher food, London and Bedford, 1938-39","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1891976","uuid":"677fd6c6-4f38-36fe-98ba-cf24877e2d5b","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1891976.0","group":"community","lon":"-0.216407085522","lat":"51.558727399805","subject":["'Customs and Practices'","'Food and Drink'","'OTHER: Religion and Beliefs'","'Religious communities'","'Second World War (1939-45)'","'World Faiths'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: Owain Davies yn cofio addurniadau'r tŷ","summary":"Owain Davies recalls home furnishings [Welsh]","title":"Owain Davies yn cofio addurniadau'r tŷ","titleCy":"Owain Davies yn cofio addurniadau'r tŷ","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/39149","uuid":"3b32ce32-1b14-3566-b9f8-666a639faec9","creationDate":"00201106-21999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-39149.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.312131000000","lat":"51.857620000000"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"A photograph of the children outside Cwmdu School in 1981.","summary":"The children and staff outside Cwmdu School.","title":"The children and staff outside Cwmdu School.","titleCy":"The children and staff outside Cwmdu School.","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/843021","uuid":"72cb8ef2-bf37-3274-9c7e-9a866baed4a4","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Talley Parish History Group","ciimId":"pcw-843021.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.193996300000","lat":"51.902003000000"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Atgofion o drychineb Aberfan a beth gofiwyd o'r darllediad a welwyd ar y teledu a'r cyfryngau.Trafodir Aberfan a'r ffaith fod y teledu trwy ddarlledu delweddau yn cael llawer mwy o effaith na fyddai clywed am y trychineb yn unig.","summary":"Aberfan - Elaine Lewis","title":"Aberfan - Elaine Lewis","titleCy":"Aberfan - Elaine Lewis","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/462097","uuid":"a3c907de-19d2-37f1-813c-8193b8bb36d4","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-462097.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.510578000000","lat":"51.658457000000","subject":["'Cities","'Communication and Media'","'Schools / Education'","Towns and Villages'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"This audio clip from an oral history interview with Herbert Patrick Anderson was recorded by the Imperial War Museums on 25 November 1998.

At the age of six, he moved to Vienna, Austria. He arrived in Britain in March 1939. After the outbreak of war, he was able to receive ‘friendly alien’ status, which enabled him to join the Pioneer Corps. He was stationed in Le Havre in France from March 1940 but returned to Britain following the retreat at Dunkirk. He was relocated to Wales and was lucky to escape from an accident involving a land mine at Pembroke Dock which killed 19 servicemen, including three German-Jewish refugees. His unit was then relocated to Carmarthen. He later served in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, and became a British citizen in 1947. Herbert died in Norfolk in 2004.\n&lt;strong&gt;Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;\nEventually, I got to Carmarthen, in charge of a small detachment of about 20 men. Now we had a most ridiculous duty. We were to dig holes into the soil in various places all over the county. Into these almost man-high holes were inserted wooden kiosks and a seat, the idea being that men would be stationed in these holes, connected to each other by telephone, in the case of an invasion. We did the job; every morning we set off in a lorry, went to another place, all over Carmarthenshire, and wondering why, because who on earth, if you were Hitler or one of his commanders, would envisage an invasion of Britain by starting in south Wales? They would have to come all around southwest England, wouldn’t they?\n[…]\nWell, the Germans never tried it, and we don’t know—we were… I am often wondering whether they’re still in various places all over Carmarthenshire.\n&lt;strong&gt;Source.&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;<a href=\"https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80017603&quot;&gt;Imperial&quot;&gt;https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80017603&quot;&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;\">https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80017603&quot;&gt;Imperia...</a> War Museum, Oral history interview with Herbert Patrick Anderson, 25 November 1998&lt;/a&gt; [accessed 15 August 2022]\nDepository: Imperial War Museums.","summary":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Herbert Patrick Anderson: his time in Carmarthenshire with the Pioneer Corps, 25 November 1998","title":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Herbert Patrick Anderson: his time in Carmarthenshire with the Pioneer Corps, 25 November 1998","titleCy":"Audio clip from an oral history interview with Herbert Patrick Anderson: his time in Carmarthenshire with the Pioneer Corps, 25 November 1998","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1896786","uuid":"653ac4f7-d84b-3bf7-8f69-474bdc5284dc","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1896786.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.312229441220","lat":"51.857677217461","subject":["'OTHER: Religion and Beliefs'","'OTHER: War","'Religious communities'","'Second World War (1939-45)'","'Soldiers'","'Warfare'","Protest and Politics'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: John Jones yn sn am ffermio yn y pumdegau","summary":"John Jones recalls farming in the fifties [Welsh]","title":"John Jones yn sn am ffermio yn y pumdegau","titleCy":"John Jones yn sn am ffermio yn y pumdegau","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/38741","uuid":"e23bea85-65bb-3908-a590-1a85c00a9096","creationDate":"00201102-05999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-38741.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.234601473416","lat":"52.920531626598"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Interview with Simon Rhys-Phillips, a Pembrokeshire resident at the time of the disaster.</span><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\" /><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Date: 01/10/16</span><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\" /><span style=\"color: rgb(106, 106, 108); font-family: Lato, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Interviewer: Ellen McAloney</span></p>","summary":"Interview about the Sea Empress oil spill with Simon Rhys-Phillips","title":"Interview about the Sea Empress oil spill with Simon Rhys-Phillips","titleCy":"Interview about the Sea Empress oil spill with Simon Rhys-Phillips","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/557349","uuid":"5efbf795-7fb2-359c-a24d-eba820d1aca3","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Ellen McAloney","ciimId":"pcw-557349.0","group":"community","lon":"-5.119628919723","lat":"51.638476213841","subject":["'Industrial Disasters'","'Seaside / Sea'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hadrian (117-138), reverse Mars.\n\nThe coins are all from the Llanvaches hoard, found in 2006 not far from Caerleon and now on display there.

He arrived in Britain as a refugee on the Kindertransport in August 1939 and went to the hachshara (agricultural training centre) at Gwrych Castle, Abergele. He joined the General Service Corps in 1944, before being transferred to the King’s Own Scottish Borderers. He later joined the Intelligence Corps and was among the first people to translate Hitler’s original will and testament when documents were discovered sewn into the shoulders of a jacket belonging to Heinz Lorenz, Joseph Goebbels’ press secretary. He subsequently wrote a book, Hitler’s Will, detailing his experiences.\n&lt;strong&gt;Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;\nTo me, I equated ‘to conform’ with having an easy life, and, and also, you learn how to dodge things if you can. However, I, I did think ‘I am doing it for a purpose’; I think this is something which may be endemic in people like myself. You know you were fighting for a cause, and therefore everything you did was for the benefit – we were idealistic in a way, I had this idealistic thought in my mind – that everything I performed and everything I did was for the benefit of society, and intimately of course – inclusive [of] – yourself.

Also reportedly found in the cave was a horse upper jaw decorated with a chevron design, which is now in the British Museum, and four bone tallies, now in Llandudno Museum. All of the teeth are incisors and are decorated with a series of incisions on the roots. All have the remains of, or a complete, perforation towards the base of the root. This suggest that they were once strung and used as beads. Some of the incisions still have traces of a red deposit. Red ochre was used at this time, and it may be there symbolically as decoration. This tooth has been radiocarbon dated. The result is later than might have been expected, falling in the Late Glacial stadial. The presence of humans in Wales during this period is unlikely, given the extreme conditions and open tundra landscape. However, the date of the tooth, apparently falls within this very cold period.

Edna shipped it to her niece in the UK shortly afterwards. Many St Lucia women used irons of this kind to make a living. They would offer a rapid laundry service to officers on the frigates moored in St Lucia&#39;s harbour - washing, drying, starching and ironing their white uniforms and returning them in pristine condition with perfect pleats ironed into the trousers. Many of the wealthy tourists who arrived on cruise ships also took advantage of this laundry service. The iron was first heated on the household fire. When it reached the ideal temperature it was wiped down with a cloth and the hard work began. The ironing itself usually took place on the kitchen table on top of a second cloth, with a third being placed on top of delicate materials like wool. Vernesta said the iron was important to her because it reminded her how hard people worked in those days. Most homes had no running water so the women would carry water from outside taps and wash the clothing by hand, using caustic blue or yellow-coloured bars of soap. There could be no delays because people needed their clothes back before they set sail again, sometimes the same day.</p>","summary":"Coal iron from St Lucia, 3D Reconstruction","title":"Coal iron from St Lucia, 3D Reconstruction","titleCy":"Coal iron from St Lucia, 3D Reconstruction","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/478575","uuid":"8a4e3387-2c17-3337-b619-a9b85fc3b553","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-478575.0","group":"community","lon":"-60.983012630190","lat":"14.018237867922","subject":["'Retail / Trade'","'Textiles","'Wool'","Fashion and Design'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Aerial photograph of Angle Bay BP Oil Terminal and Pumping Station, Popton, Milford Haven.

In the clip, Dorothy discusses her experience of becoming enemy alien at the age of 16. \n\n<strong>Transcript.</strong>\n\nSo, we, we were in Cardiff and there I went to Howell's School, which is an excellent school. I don't know how my mother heard that this was the best school, but it clearly was, and they must have scrimped and scraped. I had some sort of a scholarship, but nevertheless they had something to pay. But you know, Jewish people value education very highly and they felt it was a sacrifice worth making.\nSo, apart from the odd raids, the first I knew really seriously about the war was the day I became 16 And I think at 16 I became an enemy alien. Up to then I'd been a child but when you were 16 you were an enemy alien and I had to go and report to the police and my fellow pupils just laughed me out of it and said, \"Don't worry, we know you're not an alien.\"\n\n<strong>Dorothy Fleming - a short biography.</strong>\n\nDorothy Fleming was born in Vienna, Austria in 1928. She lived in a large flat in the fifth district of Vienna with her father who was an optician, her mother and younger sister. Their life was full and happy. They enjoyed opera, ice-skating and music. Dorothy attended the local Kindergarten and then primary school in Vienna. \n\nWhen Dorothy was ten years old, Nazi-Germany took control of Austria in what was known as the Anschluss. After the Anschluss life changed dramatically for Dorothy and her family. Soon she was unable to go to her normal school. And after the Kristallnacht, her father lost his two optician shops. Left with no other choice, her parents arranged for Dorothy and her sister to travel to Britain on a Kindertransport promising that they would follow later.\n\nAfter travelling to Britain, Dorothy lived in Leeds with her foster parents. Eventually, her parents were able to join Dorothy and her sister, and they lived in London in a small flat with other refugees. Dorothy had an uncle in South Wales who had set up a factory on the Treforest Trading Estate and she spent some time living with him.

As of today I’m Assembly Member for the Vale of Glamorgan and I’m also a minister in the Welsh Government, and have been a minister since the inception of the Assembly in 1999, I represent the Vale of Glamorgan.  And I also have had many different roles over the years including being a county councillor, and I want to - South Glamorgan County Council –  and I want to concentrate on, I want to focus on a particular event where I was very clearly standing up for a woman’s right to choose, alongside Councillor, the then Councillor, Julie Morgan - who’s actually now an Assembly Member alongside me, for Cardiff North, and she was also of course the MP for Cardiff North - but also go back to the early days of when I was involved in, and beginning to understand, the importance of the 1967 Abortion Act, standing up for it, making sure it was being properly implemented, and I very much welcome this Safe and Legal project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nSo it’s interesting to look back at a book written by Dee Beddoe, who was a professor of women’s history at the University of South Wales, formerly the University of Glamorgan.  She wrote a history of women in the twentieth century in Wales called Out of the Shadows. She’s reminded me of the fact that we were setting up in the 1970s, as part of our developing interest in the women’s movement, an organisation called the Cardiff Women’s Action Group. I was an active member of the Cardiff Women’s Action Group, we had a lot of different issues, we were tackling women’s unemployment, unfair restrictions to Family Allowances and also looking at abortion rights.  And of course if we look at the four initial demands of the women’s liberation movement: equal pay, equal education opportunity, 24-hour nurseries, free contraception, and abortion on demand, in a sense we were looking at those issues and campaigns and then looking at how it reflected in our experience locally.  So in those mid-70s we set up that group, Cardiff Women’s Action Group.  We became aware of the fact, and of course the 1967 Act had been implemented, we became aware of the fact that actually there had been set up at the University Hospital of Wales a lunchtime, what was described as a lunchtime abortion clinic.  And obviously, in order to carry out abortions under the 1967 Abortion Act.  And we at that time, we found out that it wasn’t being used.  We asked for statistics, to find out that the usage, because obviously this would have been much more available and accessible to women who were able to get terminations under the 1967 Abortion Act. And we discovered that there was some resistance to using that Act by a particular, at that time, a particular gynaecologist – obstetrician.  So we really raised this as a major issue.  Now I recall now that I was, well I think that centre, according to Dee Beddoe’s book, was opened in 1973.  But I was also then, obviously, getting involved as the years went by, in demonstrations and marches in 1975, 79 and 81, against various backbench member attempts to dilute the 1967 Abortion Act.  But in 1976, I think, I haven’t quite checked back, I was appointed a member of Cardiff Community Health Council by the then Secretary of State for Wales Alec Jones,  and was able then to sort of step, which I’ve always done, in my political life, have one, you know, clear foot and reference group in the Women’s Action Group, with, where we were concerned with women’s issues, to step into a more formal role as a member of the Cardiff Community Health Council, where I was then able to raise more formally the issue of our concerns and seek discussions, meetings, statistics and I think those, some of those minutes have been highlighted on the Safe and Legal exhibition which unfortunately I haven’t yet seen, but I know it’s coming to the Senedd, and there’s an event in January which Jenny Rathbone, Assembly Member for Cardiff Central, is hosting, and I shall certainly be at that event.\nSo the sort of history is there in terms of what we sought to do, I mean what we were seeking to do was ensure that the 1967 Abortion Act was being fully implemented, under the terms of that Act, as the title of this project, it was to ensure that there were safe, there was safe and legal access to abortion under the 1967 Abortion Act.  So I don’t know what actually happened in the end in terms of that centre, the clinic at the Heath Hospital, in fact probably it, I’m sure, in terms of the statistics, there were terminations, at, through the University Hospital of Wales, as a result of the Abortion Act, but this, what seemed to be a very progressive way forward in terms of that, what it would have been would be a day clinic, in NHS terms, access to a day clinic which of course so many procedures under the NHS do take place in day clinics which of course particularly would have been very helpful and convenient for women.  And also, obviously, enabling them to access this at a very early stage in terms of a pregnancy which was then going to be terminated under the 1967 Abortion Act, under the criteria.\nSo I want to move on to demonstrate the kind of, my interest and engagement in this particular issue alongside a lot of other women’s rights issues, took me on to 1981, when I was, I stood for election to the South Glamorgan County Council.  What was interesting about that, as I said, I was very involved in campaigns but also, being approached to perhaps, I think the words were said to me that you know, you need to sort the, sort the system out from within as well as campaign from outside government and statutory arrangements.  So I did put myself forward to stand in the election in 1981 and was elected to the Riverside ward. Now what’s very interesting is that for the first few years there were very few women on the South Glamorgan County Council, I was a comparatively young woman standing,. I was also, in 1978, I had become the co-ordinator of Welsh Women’s Aid setting up Women’s Aid refuges all over Wales.  So I was well known for my women’s, focus on women’s issues, as a – and was identified as a feminist and a socialist, which was also very much the forefront of my political engagement with the Labour Party and with the Labour Women’s movement, which I was very involved in, for example in the campaign with Anita Gale, now Baroness Gale, against the use of Depo-Provera, which was another campaign issue affecting women, young women in particular.  But I became a councillor and I think one of the interesting issues as, because I was well known as a women’s rights, in terms of women’s rights, as a feminist, there was some campaigning against me standing for the local, in the local elections, and I can’t remember it further, it was 1981 or 1985 which was the next election, where there was a leaflet put out particularly targeting ethnic minorities in the Riverside ward, saying that I was pro-abortion.  So we thought that might have had an impact on the election but in fact it didn’t and I did succeed, and in fact was a councillor for twelve years, serving the Riverside ward and I obviously used this opportunity to try and explain my position in terms of the 1967 Abortion Act which, the legalities in terms of a woman’s right to choose, and to also, obviously, promote access to contraception, and particularly raise awareness of what was then called Family Planning, and in terms of access to local clinics.\nI think I might then move on to just my second sort of, perhaps where I hit the headlines, was in 1985, when I stood again for the Council, I was really pleased to be joined by Julie Morgan, who I knew very well as a campaigner on a number of fronts.  So 1985, we decided to set up a Women’s Committee.  This was very much following what had happened in London in the GLC, the Greater London Council, which was led by Ken Livingstone, and Valerie Wise had set up a Women’s Committee, so we thought we’d follow the same footsteps, follow the same route, setting up a Women’s Committee, which was a formal Committee of South Glamorgan County Council.  I was the Chair, Julie Morgan was the Vice-Chair, and we had a range of co-optees onto the Committee as well as our councillors, elected councillors. And we decided to have an International Women’s Day event, and in 19 – that took us - the first one I’m sure would have been in 1986.  Now why this hit the headlines was that on International Women’s Day, 8th March 1986, we had the displays and information in County Hall and unfortunately one organisation, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, and the Catholic Mothers’ Group, who we had liaised with very closely on a number of issues, decided to put leaflets on a stall at the event which were particularly focused on the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, very upsetting literature, and people were very concerned about it.  And the, at that time, I did ask those who were at that stall whether they would remove this literature, and we just felt it wasn’t wise to have the leaflets there.  Anyway, the – this resulted in quite a lot of publicity, there was a letter in the Echo around that time, it must have been April I think, 86, from myself, headed Why We Banned Open Day Leaflet, and then there was a letter on the same day, or perhaps a week later, from Julie Morgan, Councillor Julie Morgan, as well, and I think, and then there was a picture in the Echo on 21st April with myself and in fact and my daughter Jessica who was aged six months at the time, and the headline Ms Hutt Calls for Abortion Ceasefire.  And the, there was quite a lot of publicity at the time about this, and in fact of course we had quite a lot of criticism from other councillors, and I think one of the important things was that I said in response to some of these issues that this, clearly, we needed to discuss this, and we had a discussion at the following meeting and agreed that we would need to set up guidelines in terms of future events.  And in fact the Women’s Committee did continue and had annual events and I think it was very important that we did take responsibility for this, and that we said that this was something which we needed to handle carefully, responsibly.\n  So I think the, this, obviously having this Safe and Legal Campaign has reminded us of those early days, where we thought we had overcome a lot of those kinds of actions, where the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child was particularly active, and you know, since that time, I’ve had various roles and responsibilities including for nearly six years being the first Minister for Health and Social Services in Wales, and also recognising that there was so much that we needed to do in terms of providing access to services and information for women.  But then also realising that the campaigns against, for example, the pregnancy advisory organisations in Cardiff started up again, and I’m very much aware of what this has meant, the harmful impact that has had on women, and in fact, only yesterday, I noted, this is, we’re now talking 22nd October, I noted in the Sunday paper, that one council, I think it might have been the London Borough of Ealing and we’d need to check, was actually considering having a buffer zone by an abortion clinic, and I think that’s, is a start of something which then could be taken up by other local authorities.  And the horrendous ways in which women have been treated in terms of access to not just that clinic but indeed clinics in Cardiff as well.  So I think the Safe and Legal campaign has brought us back to recognise that there is so much more to do, and that we need to take responsibility.\nNow I just, looking at some of the other issues that are raised for the Safe and Legal campaign, as I mentioned and indeed, obviously others have given much greater detail about backbench members’ attempts to change the 1967 Abortion Act, but this is something where we have to be vigilant and alert to the fact that this could happen again, and I think it’s something where we have to be very clear that we have a responsibility, and it’s for me, particularly, as an elected member, but also, an Assembly Member, but also, the fact that my interest in politics came from a feminist socialist perspective, of how I wanted to ensure that women’s rights particularly were being addressed and backed, and that women were being empowered and that’s obviously my involvement in Women’s Aid for many years, but also promoting equality of opportunity.","summary":"Jane Hutt - abortion rights in Cardiff, Wales","title":"Jane Hutt - hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","titleCy":"Jane Hutt - hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1152076","uuid":"8ac7047a-895a-3e71-a58a-51917189efca","creationDate":"-2017102-3000000.0","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1152076.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.162800772400","lat":"51.463444087894","subject":["'Activism and Pressure Groups'","'Civil and Political Rights'","'Health and Social Care'","'OTHER: Community and Social'","'OTHER: War","'People and Family'","'Political Parties'","'Societies and Clubs'","Protest and Politics'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"All Merthyr Express records re.

The valley around Aberfan had been piled high with spoil from the nearby Merthyr Vale Colliery, and, a little after 9am, 'Tip 7' began to move. Within minutes a vast landslip of shale and coal dust hurtled down the mountain, becoming liquefied by underlying water and engulfing everything in its path. 1,000 tonnes of colliery spoil wiped away two farm cottages, several houses, and tore into the side of Pantglas Junior School. 144 people were killed, 116 of them children, triggering a profoundly emotional response across Wales and throughout the international community. Thousands rushed to help with the rescue effort while sympathies and financial support poured in from around the world.Over a period of fifty years since that black October, a myriad of poems, photographs, musical compositions and films have commemorated the tragedy and the lives lost.

Time of national-emergency touched every aspect of civil & community life. Especially for the Jones brothers and their modest agricultural machinery works in Rhosesmor, North Wales. Keeping abreast of repair-work and small-scale production of harvesting equipment was an everyday challenge.\n\nHard--pressed farm machinery, much needed for food production, was breaking-down and wearing-out. Whilst official allocation of resources of money, materials and manpower was driven by the immediate demands of the military, supplies to anyone outside the armaments industry were considered a low priority. Workshop items such as bearings, drill-bits and welding rods were almost impossible to obtain.\n\nThe brothers were aware that the spares they needed might sometimes be begged, traded or scavenged from small workshops over the border on Merseyside and beyond. But getting these past the security checks on the bridge across the Dee at Queensferry, would present its own challenge.\n\nBut wasn't harvesting the crops of North Wales -and consequent feeding of the population- a legitimate part of the national war-effort? \nAnd, like many in rural Wales, didn't the Jones's have a \"domestic\" supply of fresh pork, chickens and eggs in their back-yard?\n\nWith enemy U-boats hunting mercilessly in the Atlantic, sinking vast tonnage of ships bound for Britain with food, the needs of a hungry population demanded drastic action! And so the creative talents of the Jones enterprise was brought to bear to engineer a solution. A bargain at the bridge.\n\nProducer: John Butler\nAssistant: Ennis Hall","summary":"Bargain At The Bridge  - a tale of war-time, farming food-production, recounted by Noel Jones","title":"Bargain At The Bridge - hanes ffermio a chynhyrchu bwyd yn ystod y rhyfel yn cael ei adrodd gan Noel Jones","titleCy":"Bargain At The Bridge - hanes ffermio a chynhyrchu bwyd yn ystod y rhyfel yn cael ei adrodd gan Noel Jones","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1243351","uuid":"2f029b07-4748-384a-b762-41fcd44c6ebb","creationDate":"-0020190-813000000","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1243351.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.014459623458","lat":"53.209589796480","subject":["'Agriculture'","'Farms and Smallholdings'","'Food Industry'","'Food and Drink'","'Legends","'Markets'","'Second World War (1939-45)'","'Steel'","'Transport'","Tales and Myths'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: Owain Davies yn sn am gael peiriant golchi [Saesneg]","summary":"Owain Davies recalls the washing machine","title":"Owain Davies yn sn am gael peiriant golchi [Saesneg]","titleCy":"Owain Davies yn sn am gael peiriant golchi [Saesneg]","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/39157","uuid":"fad8a329-4ca9-3dec-bca0-1cc4fd479f7a","creationDate":"00201106-21999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-39157.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.312131000000","lat":"51.857620000000"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"<p>Fideo yn dangos y newidiadau a wnaed yn Llyfrgell Bangor yn ystod cyfnod Covid-19.

The Pursuers, as they are known, are seen on a camping holiday in Llanbedr which includes an ascent of Snowdon and pilchards for breakfast. DESCRIPTION: As this promotional film concludes, it is easier to get out and about with The Pursuers than attempting to organise such activities yourself. Rather than sitting about listening to records or taking part in amateur dramatics - standard fare at other clubs for young people - you could be enjoying the outdoor life, camping with the group, undertaking a competition walk, or learning how to read a map at the group's headquarters at Ware College (although the film shows its previous location - the cellars of Westfield, Hertford, a mansion owned by Hertfordshire County Council). The club was started by staff of the local College of Further Education but became a self-governing society. The film was made with money provided by the County Council for promotional purposes. Canoeing, swimming in the sea, rock and mountain climbing are all on offer and the group are present at the centenary celebration held for 'Prince', a Ffestiniog Railway locomotive, on 4/8/1963. You'd be advised, though, to get yourself a decent pair of boots if you want to join a walk or climb. The footwear seen on the feet of the club members traversing rocks and wet ground is highlighted and not recommended! NOTE: This Standard 8mm film was acquired with a separate reel-to-reel sound track of the voice-over; a cassette tape recording of the voice-over plus incidental (copy-righted) music, and a DVD copy with the voice-over and music plus title and credits added. It has not been possible to synchronise the images with the separate sound - and there is a copyright issue - so the version seen here is mute.

Prior experience had told the Health Board that closing smaller community hospitals could have a devastating effect on staff morale. The Employee Well Being Service worked with the Caerphilly Locality Office to produce a physical memento that could help with the closure and transition process.\n\nThe 'Miners' was a true community hospital, opened in 1923 through a weekly subscription from miners' wages. Many of the staff lived locally, had been born there, met their spouses there and knew many of the patients that they treated. The patients were friends, the consultants were gods and their workmates were a real family. And, of course, funny things happened on the way to the theatre. Two events were held to collect information; the first collected photographs and memorabilia; the second collected the stories that can be heard in the film. Over 175 copies have been distributed to staff and families - they have already gone as far afield as Australiaand Canada- and, hopefully, the stories softened the blow of losing a much loved hospital.\n\nThis film has been split up into 5 chapters.","summary":"Caerphilly District Miners Hospital 1923-2011, 3/5","title":"Caerphilly District Miners Hospital 1923-2011, 3/5","titleCy":"Caerphilly District Miners Hospital 1923-2011, 3/5","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/43546","uuid":"af8d334c-695e-3e18-a12c-7ffb48f1975b","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-43546.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.231304000000","lat":"51.569450000000","subject":["'Health and Social Care'","'People and Family'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Hanes llafar: Stuart Davies yn cofio cosbi tra'n bennaeth yn y 1990au [Saesneg]","summary":"Stuart Davies recalls punishment in the 1990s as a headteacher","title":"Stuart Davies yn cofio cosbi tra'n bennaeth yn y 1990au [Saesneg]","titleCy":"Stuart Davies yn cofio cosbi tra'n bennaeth yn y 1990au [Saesneg]","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/37533","uuid":"a62a2793-eabd-310c-8a50-74195cb54a84","creationDate":"00201011-19999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Canolfan Peniarth","ciimId":"pcw-37533.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.943646000000","lat":"51.621440000000","subject":["1990s","English oral history","SWANSEA","Stuart Davies","headteacher","punishment"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Dyma ffilm fer sy'n cynnwys rhai o'r straeon digidol a'r ffotograffau a gasglwyd gan gymuned Merthyr Tudful ar gyfer arddangosfa yr Athro Paul Carr yn y Redhouse rhwng 27 Ionawr a 24 Chwefror 2018.

I’ve been a member of the Labour Party - since I joined in 1979.  But for the purposes of the interview I suppose my main involvement was that I was an official with the Labour Party, with the Wales Labour Party, as an assistant regional organiser, as it was then termed, from 1985 to 1991.  And I then became one of the founding members of the National Assembly for Wales in 1999, having headed up the referendum campaign for the Labour Party in 1997.  And I was a Welsh Government minister from 1999 until I stood down in 2009 and left the National Assembly in 2011.\nI was very conscious during my teenage years under the Labour government of Harold Wilson of 1964 to 1970, particularly Roy Jenkins when he was Home Secretary, of a very progressive movement towards what I suppose we would now call a rights-respecting approach by government.  Obviously although the David Steel 1967 Act was a Private Member’s Act it was clear that it would never have reached the statute book if  it hadn’t had the support of Government, and in particular Roy Jenkins as Home Secretary.  Of course at the time you also had the decriminalisation of homosexuality and obviously there was a big drive towards tackling discrimination against black people.  So it was a very progressive period even though he was only Home Secretary for two years, and the legacy was very clear.  So while I was aware of that, in the, as a teenager, I’d always, I suppose, been on the left politically, for both political and personal reasons, which I’ll touch on later, abortion rights was always something I felt very strongly about.\nAs I’ve said, I became Assistant Regional Organiser, as it was then called, I think it’s now called Deputy General Secretary or Assistant General Secretary, of the Labour Party, and my boss was the then Regional Organiser, or the now – it would then be termed – it would now be termed General Secretary – was Anita Gale, who is now Baroness Gale, I think of Treherbert, a member of the House of Lords.  She had previously been Assistant Regional Organiser before her promotion, and had been Secretary of the Regional Women’s Committee, as it was called then, the Wales Labour Party Women’s Committee, and was deemed the Women’s Officer.  I took over that role when she was promoted, so I was actually Secretary of the Women’s Committee, I preferred that rather than being called the Women’s Officer - for obvious reasons (laughs).  The Regional – at the time – just to give you some background in the structure, there were – obviously there were 40 Constituency Labour Parties in Wales; most, if not all, had what were called Women’s Councils, and that was the women’s organisation at a constituency level.  And within each constituency party, within each Women’s Council, you could then have smaller Women’s Sections, which would either be based on, would organise on the basis of a Labour Party branch, or a ward.  And then there would be an annual Women’s Conference, nearly always held in South Wales because that was where the bulk of the membership were, was located, and normally it would alternate between Swansea and Cardiff, although occasionally it was held in other venues.  And then delegates from the Women’s Councils and the Women’s Sections elected delegates for the conference, and it was at the conference itself that the Regional Women’s Committee of the, the all-Wales, Wales Labour Party Women’s Committee, was elected.\nOf course in those days, this was pre-devolution, the Labour Party was quite strongly centralist.  The Wales Labour Party, I always felt, was quite deferential really towards the party at a UK level.  I always noticed that the Scottish colleagues were much more assertive – they tended to knock the door down rather than knock on the door, we tended to knock on the door.  So the Wales Labour Party Executive Committee, which was the ultimate, at a Wales Labour Party level, was the ultimate deciding body, was again elected at the Wales Labour Party Conference, and it didn’t really have a great deal of power, for example at every annual conference there would be resolutions passed, and most of those resolutions would end up being sent to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party.  And there was, and I felt this was the big difference between Wales and Scotland, there was a lack of confidence within the Party in Wales, and maybe that’s why the referendum for devolution in 1979, one of the reasons it was lost so heavily.\nSo any decisions by the Regional Women’s Committee would be on the whole, usually, sent to the Executive of the Wales Labour Party for consideration, although occasionally there would be those items which would be decided on and then referred to the national party.  I think the other thing to bear in mind is that in the 1980s the Wales Labour Party was quite a heavily male-dominated organisation and culture.  At the time there was only woman MP, that was Ann Clwyd, who was elected for Cynon Valley in 1985, and before that she’d been the MEP for Mid and West Wales, and I got to know Ann very well, in my time, both when I was a Labour Party activist before I became an official, and afterwards.  And I think that has to be borne in mind, when you think of the political culture, in the Labour Party, it was heavily dominated by men, and older men at that, and at the same time it was heavily dominated by the trade unions, particularly then the Transport and General Workers’ Union, and the Miners’ Union, and the Engineers’ Union.  So I think that’s important to stress, in terms of the political culture.\nSo raising any issue which was either seen as controversial or could be seen as affecting women in particular was always maybe a bit of a, an uphill struggle.  In terms of the, the Regional Women’s Committee and the Women’s Conference - at the time, the Labour Party was quite, I would say, loyalist, in its view in it, it’s always struck me that the Labour Party in Wales has never really ever been, it was never particularly Blairite, in the 1980s, and it was never particularly - sorry, Bennite – in the 1980s, and neither was it particularly Blairite, when Tony Blair became leader.  And it has always struck me that left-wing groupings were always, tended to be, quite small.  I in particular, I was in, for example, a member of what was then the Labour Co-ordinating Committee in the early 1980s, and that’s where I first met someone who was to become a fellow Assembly Member and minister, Sue Essex.  But these groups tended to be quite small and restricted to Cardiff and Swansea, and to some extent Newport as well.  So again I think that needs to be borne in mind in terms of the political culture at the time.\nBut nevertheless there was a sort of – after the 1983 election there were lots of people who had joined - like myself in 1979 and subsequently – and certainly the women’s organisation I think had a fresh input, input or influx, of more left-wing, younger more left-wing women.  And this was reflected in both the annual conference of the, both in Wales and at the UK level, and the party at a UK level, I remember, I was the organiser, before becoming the, one of the Wales organisers I was the Labour Party agent in Swansea in 1984.  And the national, i.e. the UK Women’s Conference was held, actually held in Swansea, purely fortuitously my home town, and I was involved in the organisation of it.  And I remember there was huge nervousness in the UK Labour Party organisation about the conference to be held.  I wasn’t aware initially what lay behind this, but there had been, the Par – the Women’s Conference hadn’t been held for at least a year, or maybe longer, because the previous occasion it had been held, I think in Bridlington, and there had been some quite divisive debates, quite a lot of protests, with the influx of new, more radical left-wing women, and it had been quite a difficult occasion.  The Party hadn’t actually held the Women’s Conference for some time.  So the first time it had been re-held was in Swansea and I, I was involved in the Party organisation.  So I suppose the women’s organisation reflected the wider party and you had a, on the whole a younger, more radical left-wing women round the Women’s Action Committee, for example, some of them were, had come from left-wing groups, Marxist groups, like the IMG or, what that became, the International Marxist Group and the SWP which then merged, became Socialist Action.  And then on the one hand, on the other hand you had the more traditional and possibly older women, some of whom were councillors, either district or county councillors because at that time we didn’t have the unitary authorities as we do now, and maybe more traditional, with a union background.  So you had, I wouldn’t say it was split, but there was a clear difference, I think, in both Conference and the Regional Women’s Committee.  However, on certain issues, like abortion rights, and the abortion campaign, you would often I think both sides would come together and have common cause.  The older women could remember a time when abortion was illegal, I don’t know whether any of them, I don’t recall anybody actually talking about their own personal experience, but certainly they were talking about experience of friends and family and neighbours who had gone through an experience, often horrifying experience, pre the 1967 Act.  So I think this is one area where, I think, the, both wings, if you could put it like that, or the broad range of opinion, came together to campaign.  And obviously there'd been previous approaches to amend or water down the 1967 Act, but of course it was the David Alton amendment, the second time he tried this, obviously he’d tried in 1980, and he tried again in 1987.  And I don’t remember the detail, but, and hopefully this may be available through either the Regional Women’s Committee minutes, or the resolutions that go to the annual Women’s Conference, in 1987, and I hope those records still exist and the detail can be recovered, but certainly from my memory is, there was a real determination to support, to support the campaign, the National Abortion Campaign, and the other local campaigns too, and stop the Bill, the Alton Bill.  And that would – so local Women’s Councils, Constituency Women’s Councils, Women’s Sections, Constituency Labour Parties, were all encouraged to lobby their own Members of Parliament, speak to their Members of Parliament where obviously they had Labour MPs, and to use any avenue they could to build support against the Alton amendment and the Alton Bill.\n What was interesting, was that I remember, and bearing in mind that obviously as an official I wasn’t allowed to be politically active, but nevertheless I was hugely supportive of this for reasons I’ll go into later.  I remember sending a report or resolution from the Women’s Committee to the Executive of the Party, which you must remember at the time was largely male-dominated, and dominated by the interests I mentioned before, the trade unions and older, maybe more right-of-centre – the Wales Labour Party Executive was never a left-wing body, or particularly radical.  But I remember sending a report, or taking a resolution, to the Executive.  And the debate that happened there, I remember Jack Brooks, Lord Jack Brooks, the late Lord Jack Brooks, expressing reservations, and concerns about the tone of the resolution and the motion, and it was clearly a concern that this was going to upset Catholic interests, not least in his constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth.  So that gave a flavour of some of the politics that was going on at the time.  But certainly the Women’s Committee, and many Women’s Councils and Women’s Sections across Wales were very active in the campaign.  But bearing in mind that most MPs in Wales at the time were men, there was only, as far as I can remember at the time there was only one woman MP, Labour MP, Ann Clwyd.  And of course there were those Members of Parliament like Paul Murphy, the MP for Torfaen, who was first elected in 87, who was Catholic.  I don’t know what Paul’s position was on the amendment, I know I always found him a very reasonable man to deal with, but of course that was part of the, part of the, some of the, I wouldn’t say the subtleties, but some of the factors that we were aware of when as a committee we were supporting the campaign and trying to get support against, against the Bill.  So certainly that was my recollection of the, of that 1987 attempt, I don’t know if that’s helpful, or useful.  OK?\nI suppose I couldn’t, as I’ve said I was an official from 1985, well 84 actually, including my time in Swansea, till 1991 where I left working for the Labour Party and went to work for Ford Motor Company.  And I returned to active politics when I was asked by Ron Davies, who was then Shadow Secretary of State for Wales, and Peter Hain, to head up the referendum campaign in 1997.  And it was always, throughout the time, whether it was from the Corrie attempt to amend the Bill, through Alton’s in 1980 and then 1987 and all the others, it was always something I felt very strongly about, and I probably, the thing I felt most consistently strongly about, amongst a lot of other things, of course, the 1980s was a time with a deep polarisation in British politics, very similar to what’s happening today.  And it was some time later that I realised what it was – I was the youngest of five children, by some way, and I was born in 1952.  And my mother had been a nurse, she had worked in, it wasn’t then the NHS, it was pre the NHS, it formed in 1948, so she worked under the old system, and was always passionate in support of the NHS, based on her experience as a nurse when it was effectively a private, privately delivered.  She never ever returned to working as a nurse, and I always felt it was a huge loss, she was, as it turned out subsequently, my both parents died in 1987, and in going through their papers after their death it was clear that she was a very skilled and committed nurse, and her testimonials were glowing, so it always struck me as a tragedy that she never returned to nursing.  It was some years after they died, and ironically after the Alton amendment, when I was still working for the Labour Party, that I was talking to one of my aunts who lived in Cardiff, and then subsequently Dinas Powys, who was my, one of my father’s sisters, who told me of an occasion when she had gone to see – I was born in Hereford, and grew up in Hereford – and she had gone to see my parents and she was talking to my mother, this would have been in 1951 I think, and my mother burst into tears, and when my Aunty Nesta asked my mum why she was, why she was so upset, she – my mum - said that she was pregnant.  And obviously, it turned out to be with me.  And she was distraught, because my twin brother and sister, who were six years older than me, they were born in 1946, were going to school, and my mother had been planning on going back to work as a nurse to, as she described it, buy gabardine macs for my twin brother and sister.  And of course, with me coming along, she didn’t return to work and never did return to work.  Although my aunty apparently lent her money to buy the gabardine macs.  And I suppose, my mother suffered very badly from depression, on and off, and I think a lot of that was frustration, at never returning to work, she was obviously a very skilled and committed nurse.  And it always felt very much a real waste.\n So I suppose my reflection is that I’ve always been in favour of abortion, not necessarily because it’s a woman’s right to choose, but because I believe passionately that every child should be wanted.  So I suppose that’s really the drive, been the drive for me.  No, I just hope now that it’s, that the Act is a settled matter.  I think the world has changed – not least, we have, I’m glad to say, a lot more women in the, as Members of Parliament, in Wales, but across the UK, and I was particularly delighted, because having campaigned for twinning in the elections for the very first Assembly, as a result of that very brave decision I think that the Party took and one that I was active in supporting at the time, we had a, the first legislature in the world, I think, which was 50 per cent men and women.  And I was also delighted to serve alongside Rhodri Morgan as a minister, and to have I believe the first Cabinet in the world, of nine members, five were women and four were men.","summary":"Andrew Davies  - memories of abortion rights activism in Cardiff, Wales","title":"Andrew Davies  - atgofion  actifiaeth hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","titleCy":"Andrew Davies  - atgofion  actifiaeth hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1152061","uuid":"cbe94470-07a2-3ea5-a8fc-06fd2ed97cbc","creationDate":"-2017101-5000000.0","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1152061.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.162908060761","lat":"51.463354519389","subject":["'Activism and Pressure Groups'","'Civil and Political Rights'","'Health and Social Care'","'OTHER: Community and Social'","'OTHER: War","'People and Family'","'Societies and Clubs'","Protest and Politics'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"<p>Mrs Elisabeth Mary Barnett, known as Molly, was born in Tredegar.

I know I first started taking the pill when I was, left school.  I felt very guilty – I think there was, which was also a new thing at the time, it became available I think in 1967, and I think there was a sort of guilt about allowing women to be so sort of independent in terms of their sexual lives, and that definitely had an impact on me.  So I didn’t actually have a view, on abortion, I didn’t think it was right or wrong, but I didn’t really think I would want to have an abortion myself, so that’s how I was thinking at the end of the 1960s.  By 1973 I’d had a child, as it happens my only child. I’d also had two miscarriages and threatened to miscarry him.  But about six months after he was born, I went to the Cardiff Women’s Action Group, which was the local group of the women’s liberation movement.  And people there were talking about abortion, and I explained, you know, I wasn’t very sure about this, I didn’t think I’d would have an abortion myself, and by the time the discussion had finished, and the meeting had finished, and people had addressed all the sort of concerns and laid out a lot of the facts, I came away thinking “oh right, this has got to be a choice for every woman in this world, I can’t, I’ll have to just keep fighting for that right until that’s the case.”  So, you know, and that’s been my view ever since.\nQ: So what was your view of the 1967 Abortion Act?\nWhen I, once I did understand the importance of abortion in women’s lives, I also understood that there were certain limits to the 1967 Abortion Act, that you had to get two doctors to sign it, and so on, which could be quite restrictive.  And also quite quickly that there was a certain postcode lottery in terms of delivering the service in various areas of the country, particularly in Cardiff, as it happens.  So I understood that it was a good thing, that there would be no more backstreet abortions, no more unwanted children, because women had that choice, but there were still difficulties in the way the Act was formulated.  But nevertheless it was a great step forward for women.\nQ: What brought you into campaigning on the issue of abortion rights?\nOk, well two things I suppose initially would be firstly the James White bill, which was the first of a series of Private Members’ Bills that tried to overturn parts of the Act and render the Act far, far less effective for women – I didn’t do an awful lot at that time because my son was still just two, and I was breaking up a marriage and so on, so I didn’t have an awful lot of time.  But I did go on my first national demonstration, to protest against the James White bill, which was a very liberating experience.  And then almost about the same time, or shortly afterwards, it became very apparent that although funding had been made available in the Health Service for a day care abortion clinic in Cardiff, there was a professor at the Heath Hospital called, a professor at the Heath Hospital who was opposed to abortion and wouldn’t allow this clinic to be established there.  So there was a concerted campaign locally for the next couple of years around that, involving lots of women, and men, and various organisations and so on, to try and get that, that clinic opened - which never did happen actually – but nevertheless it was very important that that campaign was waged.  And then we moved very shortly after that, in the mid-70s, with the next of the Private Members’ bills, which came from a Scottish MP called William Benyon.  So there was a campaign against that, though it wasn’t such a high-profile campaign as the James White, the one against the James White bill.  So, that’s how it started.\nQ: What organisations have you been involved in, through campaigning?\nI’m not quite sure what you mean by that, actually.\nQ: Through unions, political parties, student organisations?\nYeah, I mean the women’s movement was very important, and the Labour Party, particularly going into the 80s, through the women’s organisation in the Labour Party there was a lot of campaigning around abortion rights; trade unions were always regarded as particularly central, although I wasn’t a member at the time, I\nwasn’t in work -  students have always been important.\nQ: How long were you involved in campaigning?\nWhenever it’s been needed, I’ve been involved in campaigning, so in terms of the William Benyon bill then that was followed by the Corrie bill, 79-80, and thinking about 1986 there was the Alton bill, and then 87-88 there was the attempt by anti-abortionists to amend the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, which – they were trying to reduce the time limits for abortion.  So I was involved in all of those campaigns, and it was only after we’d defeated the attempt to reduce the time limits, in the Stop the Amendment campaign, that actually there were no further major assaults on the 1967 Act until 2008 when there was another attempt to, there was another Human Fertilisation and Embryology type of a bill going through Parliament and again there were attempts to reduce the time limits on that.  I mean there’ve been smaller attempts, to sort of try and undermine the Act, but that’s not, none of them have ever sort of reached the status where there’s, it’s been necessary to have a national campaign.  So after the defeat of the anti-abortionists in the Stop the Amendment campaign, they were really on the back foot for two – for a couple of decades actually – and they again failed to amend the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill in 2008.  And since then, a lot of focus of anti-abortionists has been on the, on abortion clinics, and protesting outside clinics, so that in Cardiff for the last five years I believe, every Lent, anti-abortionists stand outside the clinic every day, and they sort of intimidate women using the clinic.  So the pro-choice movement has responded with demonstrations and petitions and just also providing a counter-presence at the clinic, a peaceful counter-presence at the clinic, to ensure that women who are using the clinic and staff who work in the clinic know there is a basis of support for them, as well.  So it’s really just been ongoing over the years, but I don’t know if you want me to go into any more detail?\nQ: What sort of things were you involved in?\nI remember the first national demonstration over the White bill, because that was, my first national demonstration, and there was a man who I know locally, who was also on the Bill, very quietly spoken, sort of mild-mannered man, and all of a sudden he was fist-pumping, “Not the church, not the state, women must decide their fate” and you just got the very big sense of the liberating impact of, you know, working together and campaigning for something.  In the Corrie campaign, I remember we just – we petitioned, weekly, I mean, for months, on the High Street in Cardiff, in maybe some of the localities, sometimes you would have an event where leading councillors would come, I remember during that campaign because there was huge, a huge sort of momentum around that campaign, being invited to speak at the UWIST students union, and there were sort of two hundred students turned up, you know, just huge activity around the Bill.  The, the Fight the Alton Bill campaign, it was a great campaign, huge involvement of students and trade unions, Wales TUC, was centrally involved, and we had a demonstration of six hundred people through the streets of Cardiff, and a rally afterwards with Ann Clwyd speaking, who was by then an MP.  And we also had a day conference during that campaign, to discuss all the issues that were raised.\nIf I could just stop just a moment to say that the first few attempts to challenge the 1967 Act were, all had sort of clauses within them that would really have changed the nature of the Act, to actually try and drive back the Act.  By the end of Corrie, although they’d started using the time limits, then, as a potential way to stop abortion, it must have become clear to the anti-abortionists because the defeat of Corrie was huge, you know like you had a national demonstration led by you know, the TUC General Secretary, with like fifty thousand, sixty thousand people on it, you had a Woman’s Own survey that showed 80% of people supported women’s choice, and even over 50% of Catholics, that was the case, so it was a huge defeat for Corrie.  So when it came to the Alton Bill campaign, that was all about reducing the time limits, because the anti-abortionists had changed tactic, because there must have been a recognition that continuing trying to just change the Act, remove the Act itself, wasn’t going to work, so this was, this was their new tactic.  So when we had this day conference during the Alton Bill campaign, there was a lot of work in that about this change of tactic, and how to challenge what the anti-abortionists were up to now.  I remember the doctor who came to speak was, sort of an older guy, actually, from Aberystwyth, and it was really nice that that he made, he felt so committed that he was prepared to make that journey down and speak to us all.  I think it was an organisation called Doctors for Choice, that he was, he was part of.  That event was supported by the Wales Labour Party Women’s Committee, which was a serious support for us as well.  And also during that campaign we did a survey of all the Welsh Labour MPs, to sort of find out what their voting intentions were, and we also kept a record of how they voted when it came to the different amendments on the time limits.  So that was that.  The Stop the Amendment campaign was a much more difficult campaign in lots of ways because, I think maybe people thought because we defeated Alton, or because it wasn’t a direct attack on the 67 Act itself, but was actually these amendments attached to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, that somehow it just didn’t have the purchase that some of the other campaigns had.  Nevertheless we still had a demonstration of over a hundred women through Cardiff, and still the involvement of the TUC, students, the Labour Party, and a couple of really good, really quite good public meetings, around that one, and although it was difficult, although it was smaller, it was so important, because the difference in the 22-week limit was just 46 votes, which actually meant that if 23 had switched the other way, that we would have lost that limit.  So yes, it was a very, very important campaign, and it made sure that they couldn’t actually – yes so that was, that was a very important campaign, and once the anti-abortionists had been defeated, on the time limits, because we, although a 24-week time limit was introduced, there were various exemptions to that that made it actually still a very positive outcome for the pro-choice movement.  And as I say, there wasn’t a further attempt, major attempt on the Bill until 2008. And I don’t think the anti-abortionists have, to this day, recovered to a point where they can, feel that they can do, make a major, plan a parliamentary attack on the 1967 Act.  And that’s why they’ve resorted to sort of intimidating and harassing women who are using the clinics.  I’ve remembered something actually, which pre-dates the White bill, and which came from the Women’s Action Group, which was a pamphlet, and it was called Abortion, Contraception and Facilities for Single Parents in Cardiff Now.  And it was basically a project by the Women’s Action Group, to produce information, because there was a feeling that women didn’t necessarily know what their rights were now that the 67 Act had been passed, and - so it was a well-produced little leaflet, pamphlet, actually, a dozen pages or more, and then it was sort of distributed to sort of doctors’ surgeries etcetera where they would have them, and so on, so that was really the first thing that I did in terms of abortion.\nQ. What sort of date would that have been?\nI think it was 1974, it was before the White bill, it might have been 75, but it wouldn’t have been – it might have been 75.\nQ. What kind of people have you met through the pro-choice movement?\nLots of women, who were sort of – keen to defend women’s choice in, on abortion – certainly some Irish women, it was very instructive, back in the 70s, to meet Irish women, because of course the 1967 Act wasn’t law in Northern Ireland, so both in the North and the South of Ireland, in the South because of the problems with the Catholic Church, at that time, and its influence in Irish politics, there was no sort of legal abortion provision for women, so many Irish women were still having to come to Britain to access abortion, and it was a very big issue for Irish women living here, and they would make, you know, their contributions to the campaign, I think it was always very much a sort of, a conscious, it was always very much a fact we were very conscious of in the pro-choice movement, that this Act had not been extended to Northern Ireland.  I just think many, many really talented, dynamic, concerned women, over the years, you know, and men, actually, some very supportive men.  So, I don’t really want to single people out – maybe – there was a woman called - who’s passed away now, and, she used to be a pharmacist, and she was working as a pharmacist during the 1950s and 60s, and she was very - because of that position, where she worked in a hospital, she was very familiar with women being brought into hospital, having been to the backstreet, and you know, had septic abortions, so her contributions on that were very strong and very moving.  And I remember at one Wales Labour Party conference, SPUC had a stall, and I don’t think we could get the stall removed, but they did have one of those horrible foetuses that they tend to parade around the place, and, on the stall, and Maurita was absolutely exercised by that, and she was quite an influential woman in the Labour Party, and she made sure that was taken away.  It’s always been great to have young women come on board …\nQ. So how did you communicate with one another?  In the campaign.\nWell, I suppose by letters, by phone calls – I didn’t even have a phone at home, a lot of this time – so you’d be going to phone boxes – meetings were very important, in some of the big campaigns like sort of Corrie and Alton you’d meet every week, just to make sure that you were up to speed with everything that was happening.  Yeah.\nQ. Looking back what sort of difference do you think the campaigning made?\nI think it’s made a huge difference, I think it’s made, made sure that women can access safe, free and legal abortions on the NHS in this country, notwithstanding the difficulties in some areas, which still have to be overcome, geographical areas, now, that still have to be overcome. I know I was looking at an old paper the other day and it was pointing out that in 1966 thirty women had died from backstreet abortions – well if the same figure had been true for all the years that the Act’s been in place that would mean an awful lot of women would have died.  And the same figures showed more than two and a half thousand women each year being hospitalised with septic abortions and damaged by those, and if you take that into account over fifty years as well, plus the whole phenomenon of unwanted children, the fact that before the Act women had to bear children sometimes whether they wanted them or not, and many children were put up for adoption because the mothers weren’t married and all this kind of thing, so I think it is a huge, huge impact, so sort of – it’s - but you know, it means women can sort of make choices about their lives that are good for them, good for you know, the people around them, any children that they do choose to have, and so on, so I think it’s been huge.\nQ. Are you still involved, are you aware of how things stand now?\nI am still involved, yeah.  I’m not any kind of expert, but, on the legal side of things, I don’t know where we are politically, in terms of what would be possible in terms of positive legislation, I know that many times over the years the pro-choice movement has sought to move positive legislation so that needing two doctors, for example, to sort of sign you off, to have an abortion, wouldn’t any longer be necessary.  That’s never been politically possible.  I think Jo Richardson, who, again, somebody who’s passed away, but when she was an MP in the 70s and 80s she worked enormously hard in, you know, all the campaigns to defend the Act, and beyond that she made, she personally made moves in the House of Commons to put a Private Member’s Bill that would be more positive in developing the legislation, but that proved to be impossible.  And Jo was incredible, because even when she was quite old and actually very disabled with arthritis, she would still definitely be there whenever, you know, pro-choice campaigning was needed.  I can’t remember what the question was, now?\nQ. Are you aware of how things stand now?\nYeah.  We still have a difficulty in Cardiff, we still – the abortion provision on the NHS in Cardiff is still very low compared to other areas.  And it’s been like that in Cardiff pretty much throughout the existence of the Act.  And it’s something that the Abortion Rights Group in Cardiff has tried to, to address, there’s been a cross-party meeting of Assembly Members, and we’ve raised issues with the Health Authority, so that’s something that’s ongoing, and we’re very mindful of the effect of 40 Days for Life, and SPUC, and their protests at the clinics, the clinic in the British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinic in Cardiff, and you know, and organising to ensure that women feel safe coming to the clinic for abortions.  So yes I am still involved and … I think, going back to the question about which organisations was I involved in, I was always involved in NAC, the National Abortion Campaign, which was active from 1975 through to 2003, when NAC disbanded, and the Abortion Law Reform Association, which had been the pressure group that most strongly prior to the 1967 Act being enacted, and NAC came together to form a new organisation which was called Abortion Rights.  And during the years NAC, NAC established the campaign against Corrie, the Fight the Alton Bill campaign, the FAB campaign, and the Stop the Amendment campaign.  Because NAC’s basic position was, free abortion on demand, a woman’s right to choose.  And not all people who are pro-choice would necessarily take that position, so, but they might support the existing, the provisions of the 67 Act.  So when it was under attack, by the anti-abortionists, you could get wider sort of a group of people involved in say campaigning against Corrie than actually being, sort of a member of NAC, so those are the different campaigns that came off over the years, different organisations, and yeah.\nQ. What impact did the 1967 Abortion Act have on your life?\nOK.  Well, it just meant that you became much more conscious of how these things, how women’s reproductive rights, are legislated for, around the world, how say churches, faiths, can have an impact on sort of women’s choice in these matters, in that general sense, yes,  And that’s still very much, that’s still very much the situation.  In terms of my own life, it’s meant at various times working enormously hard to sort of defend the 67 Act, and there is one situation during the Stop the Amendment campaign, I think my son was sixteen, maybe, so I was a single parent, low-paid job, and we lived on the breadline most of the time, and at one point the Stop the Amendment campaign needed some money for something, and I gave fifty pounds.  And shortly after that my cooker broke, our cooker broke down, say about December, the cooker broke down, and that campaign as I said before was a difficult campaign, there weren’t so many people involved, if we did raise money it was sort of used straight away, for the next meeting, demonstration or whatever, or mailings, because you had to do mailings then because it was before the advent of the internet and email and so on, and I think it was about May, about April, no maybe about April, the local NALGO branch made a donation of a hundred and fifty pounds, and it was only then that I was able to buy a new second-hand cooker.  So we’d gone, we went the whole winter without a cooker.  And it was a very interesting point because several years later, I would say eight-nine years later, when my son was sharing a house with some other young people, I got a call late one night, to say oh, you know, that one of the women had just confided in him that she was pregnant, and that she was very late in her pregnancy, but she wanted an abortion, I’m not sure what, she was about 18-20 weeks, or something like this, and she’d realised that she didn’t actually want to go ahead with this pregnancy, and so my son was really wanting to know who she should contact, and so on and so forth. But I was able to say to him then, you know when we didn’t have the cooker, that’s what that campaign was about, it was about making sure that women in the situation that your friend was in could still have abortions.  Because that’s exactly the kind of people that would be affected if the time limit was brought down.  Young women, and sort of … women on the menopause, and so on, you know, that actually, your awareness of the implications of everything is not necessarily going to make itself felt straight away.  You might not even be aware that you are pregnant straight away, and by the time that you get round to sort of wanting to make your choice, it can be quite late on.  So yeah, that was, there was sweet justice in that one there I think, so yeah, so it affects you in lots of different ways, I think, yes.","summary":"Maggie Simpson - memories of abortion rights activism in Cardiff, Wales","title":"Maggie Simpson - atgofion actifiaeth hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","titleCy":"Maggie Simpson - atgofion actifiaeth hawliau erthylu yng Nghaerdydd, Cymru","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1152016","uuid":"0f642506-4fd3-3fc6-832e-39fdbd6d6b96","creationDate":"-2017090-7000000.0","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1152016.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.173149724854","lat":"51.480831035998","subject":["'Activism and Pressure Groups'","'Civil and Political Rights'","'Health and Social Care'","'OTHER: Community and Social'","'OTHER: War","'Societies and Clubs'","Protest and Politics'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Datganiad o Fwriad Women in Tune Cynyddu dealltwriaeth y cyhoedd yng Nghymru drwy ddarparu cyngor a chymorth ym maes creu cerddoriaeth ac mewn gweithgareddau'n gysylltiedig chreu cerddoriaeth e.e. cerddoriaeth, dawns, barddoniaeth, drama a llenyddiaeth yn y fath ffyrdd sy'n elusengar yn y gyfraith.\n- Cynyddu dealltwriaeth am sefyllfa merched sy'n brysur ym mhob agwedd o 'r celfyddydau sy'n gysylltiedig cherddoriaeth.\n- Datblygu galluoedd a sgiliau merched yng nghymunedau difreintiedig cymdeithasol ac economaidd Ceredigion, Sir Gaerfyrddin a Sir Benfro yn y fath ffordd y byddant yn medru adnabod a chyflawni'u hanghenion a chymryd rhan yn llawnach yn y gymdeithas.","summary":"She Burns","title":"She Burns","titleCy":"She Burns","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/31736","uuid":"38e7bd9d-4c47-31f1-9628-1b211357b3f3","creationDate":"00201110-01999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Women in Tune","ciimId":"pcw-31736.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.131007700000","lat":"51.861505900000","subject":["Arts","Dance","Drama","Education","Literature","Music","Poetry","Women","book"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"An audio recording of the poem 'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron","summary":"'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron","title":"'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron","titleCy":"'She Walks in Beauty' by Lord Byron","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/19476","uuid":"b35c9dee-7d95-36f5-bb6a-b47c3da8b64e","creationDate":"00201007-21999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-19476.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.498544692993","lat":"51.403757087433","subject":"'OTHER: Arts and Crafts'"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Introduction to Ebbw Vale Steelworks recorded by Coleg Gwent students in 2009 as part of their BTECH course","summary":"The basements at Ebbw Vale Steelworks site","title":"The basements at Ebbw Vale Steelworks site","titleCy":"The basements at Ebbw Vale Steelworks site","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/19327","uuid":"0a5e5963-e60e-34fa-981a-918728fe1307","creationDate":"00200901-01999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-19327.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.205003738403","lat":"51.781010800270","subject":["basements","gardens; Ebbw Vale; steelworks"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Jill Nield talks about her background and her knowledge of Wrexham.

Wrth sôn am ei wasanaeth arferai grybwyll Marne, y Somme, Ypres a Choedwig Mametz. Adroddai un stori ddoniol am Goedwig Mametz. Roedd ef a milwr arall ar ddyletswydd yn gwarchod un noson pan welsant gysgod rhywbeth yn symud drwy'r coed. Gwyddent fod milwyr Almaenig o gwmpas yn y cyffiniau, ac felly rhoisant sialens deirgwaith, ond parhâi y cysgod i symud. Felly fe saethant beth bynnag oedd yno. Wedi iddi wawrio aethant allan i weld beth oeddent wedi saethu, gan hanner disgwyl gweld milwr Almaenig. Er syndod iddynt, roeddent wedi saethu carw, ac felly gellid disgwyl cig carw ar y fwydlen y noson honno. Ni soniodd llawer wrth ei deulu am ei wasanaeth, ond wedi iddo ddod yn saethwr, mae'n ymddangos iddo wirfoddoli i fynd i'r Machine Gun Corps, lle daeth yn saethwr cudd. Datgelodd hyn unwaith i nai iddo a oedd yn ystyried ymuno â'r Parachute Regiment. Eglurodd Richard ganlyniadau ymuno â'r Machine Gun Corps. Yn ystod un frwydr dywedodd swyddog wrtho, 'Evans, mae saethwr cudd Almaenig allan fanna. Rwyf am i ti gael gwared ohono'- a bu ef a'r gelyn wrthi am bedair awr yn saethu at ei gilydd. Yn ystod y rhyfel cafodd ei wenwyno â nwy mwstard ac am weddill ei oes dioddefai o'r canlyniadau. Bu'n rhaid i'w deulu ei wylio'n eistedd wrth y tân yn ymladd am ei anadl. Mae'n debyg mai effeithiau'r nwy mwstard oedd yn gyfrifol am y cyfnodau o niwmonia a pliwrisi a ddioddefai yn ystod gweddill ei oes. Gellid meddwl mai rhyddhad oedd ei farwolaeth yn 59 oed, wedi blynyddoedd o ddioddef fel canlyniad i'r rhyfel.","summary":"Richard Evans of the Welsh Regiment and the Machine Gun Corps","title":"Richard Evans o'r Welsh Regiment a'r Machine Gun Corps","titleCy":"Richard Evans o'r Welsh Regiment a'r Machine Gun Corps","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/27769","uuid":"e42c6755-f0bd-36b3-b7ec-140c09e6bd7a","creationDate":"00191408-019999990019181111999999","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-27769.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.948792000000","lat":"51.653973000000","subject":["MGC","WW1","Welsh Regt"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Aerial photograph of Cerrig y Barcdy Intertidal Structure.

Fodd bynnag, fe'i gwrthodwyd gan iddo gael ei weld fel baich ariannol i gwmnau morio fyddai'n gorfod ariannu'r adeiladu a chynnal a chadw'r goleudy.\n\nYm 1807, roedd y Capten Hugh Evans o Gaergybi yn pryderu cymaint am y peryglon yn yr ardal fel y lluniodd fap yn amlinellu'r holl longddrylliadau a ddigwyddodd yn ystod y deuddeng mis blaenorol a'i anfon i'r Senedd yn Llundain.  Ystyriwyd bod y colledion mor fawr fel y cafwyd caniatd ac adeiladwyd y goleudy.  Rhoddwyd golau allan gyntaf ar 9 Chwefror 1809.\n\nCynlluniwyd goleudy Ynys Lawd gan Daniel Alexander a'i adeiladu gan Joseph Nelson.  Cloddiwyd y garreg i adeiladu'r tŵr yn lleol a'i gludo i'r ynys gyda ffordd gebl.  Defnyddid dirwynlath i halio deunyddiau eraill o'r cychod at laniad ar yr ynys.\n\nRhoddwyd lampau trydan yn lle'r lampau olew yn Ynys Lawd ym 1938.  Fe'i gyrrwyd gan eneradur.  Ni chafodd y goleudy ei brif gyflenwad trydan ei hun hyd 1963.\n\nCafodd y goleudy ei awtomeiddio ym 1984.  Nid oedd angen ceidwaid bellach gan y gallai'r orsaf gael ei rheoli o bell o Ganolfan Rheoli Gweithrediad Tŷ Trinity yn Harwich.","summary":"South Stack lighthouse, Holyhead [1 of 4 images]","title":"Goleudy Ynys Lawd, Caergybi [Delwedd 1 o 4]","titleCy":"Goleudy Ynys Lawd, Caergybi [Delwedd 1 o 4]","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/11684","uuid":"a5b3d2bb-af27-3f65-aac9-583b26ba1267","creationDate":"00000000-","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"South Stack Lighthouse","ciimId":"pcw-11684.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.700188607825","lat":"53.309694330185","subject":"'Waterways and Shipping'"}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Skokholm Island selection \n\nWinter pond re-excavated.

All but two of the ten pupils were called Jones, namely: Jane Watkin, Rhian, Lowri Mair, Arfon, Ann Elizabeth, Euron, Geraint, and Eurgain;  the other pupils were Tryweryn Evans and Elwyn Rowlands.  The schoolteacher was Mrs. M. J. Roberts.  This photograph was published in 'Y Cymro', 1 November 1962.\n\nIt was in 1955 that it was first announced that Liverpool Corporation was intending to build the new reservoir in the Tryweryn valley, drowning the village of Capel Celyn, north of Bala.  Although a fierce protest campaign was launched by local residents, authorities, individuals and national institutions, all efforts to halt the building of the new reservoir ultimately failed.  On 1 August 1957 the Liverpool Corporation Act was passed.  Work began on the site three years later and was completed in August 1965.","summary":"The last days of Capel Celyn School, October 1962","title":"Dyddiau olaf Ysgol Capel Celyn, Hydref 1962","titleCy":"Dyddiau olaf Ysgol Capel Celyn, Hydref 1962","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/56","uuid":"08799888-d917-3cad-b1fb-6de26cefdce1","creationDate":"00196210-","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"The National Library of Wales","ciimId":"pcw-56.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.704383121025","lat":"52.949333614618","subject":["Children","Protest","Reservoirs","School pupils","Schools","Schoolteachers"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Old Raised Beach \n\nSand at Fontygary, Tufa on cliff \n\nDate:  July 1978","summary":"Fontygarry: Landscape & Plant/tree","title":"Fontygarry: Landscape & Plant/tree","titleCy":"Fontygarry: Landscape & Plant/tree","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/649491","uuid":"d56d0f36-2397-3cd3-8f4e-e74ce1d2a729","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"Dr Mary Gillham","ciimId":"pcw-649491.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.364364147186","lat":"51.381896972656","subject":["Fontygarry","Landscape","Plant tree"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Mae'r byntin a'r baneri allan in Wrecsam i groesawi'r Eisteddfod 2011","summary":"Bunting in Wrexham, Eisteddfod 2011","title":"Byntin Eisteddfod Wrecsam, 2011","titleCy":"Byntin Eisteddfod Wrecsam, 2011","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/29750","uuid":"9007a407-9768-3ca4-977b-378f3224fe48","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-29750.0","group":"community","lon":"-2.991673000000","lat":"53.046910000000","subject":["Eisteddfod","bunting","wrexham"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"<strong>Llun: 1</strong> \nLeys species now extinct \n\nCrambe maratima on multi-coloured pebbles.

Records suggest the football club was founded in the pub in the 1870s by cricketers who wanted a sport over the winter months. It is thought that until the 1940s, players even changed inside the pub, while for many years regulars were able to watch games from its balcony. There have been many other sporting events witnessed from the balcony. There once lay a cycling track around the pitch, and both boxing and wrestling has also taken place on the Racecourse. Up to the late 1960s the Turf itself had its own bowling green situated where the pub car park is now. The original balcony is still in place, however the view of the Racecourse is now obscured by the Mold Road stand which was redeveloped in the late 1990's.","summary":"Turf Hotel, Mold Road, Wrexham","title":"Turf Hotel, Mold Road, Wrexham","titleCy":"Turf Hotel, Mold Road, Wrexham","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/30981","uuid":"d5e06506-b8eb-32c6-bfc9-cc3a70626fd3","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-30981.0","group":"community","lon":"-3.003864000000","lat":"53.051250000000","subject":["Football","Public House","pub","racecourse"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Llangollen.

We stopped at several very large stations, such as Neath, Newport, Cardiff, Gloucester and Swindon. Although small we had to stay at Port Talbot, because the whole of the place is owned by a Lady called Miss Talbot (a millionaire). She lives at Margam Abbey, a lovely place, which we can see, just above the trees, there are several lodges, and summer houses about it. After we passed Reading, we saw the large biscuit factory of Huntley and Palmer; also Suttons Gardens, which were all laid out with flowers and vegetables, to show the people. We had a good view of Windsor Castle, it is an immense building; the flag was not flying, as the Queen was at Balmoral. \nWhen we got to Paddington, the scene was one of great bustle and confusion. Porters at different doors of the carriages waiting to be employed, one of whom soon hailed a cab for us; after finding our box, we started for Queen's Road, Dalston, which occupied us half an hour, raining heavily. We found Aunt and cousin waiting for us quite well. After chatting, taking tea, and supper, we went to bed and slept like tops. \nSaturday, September 19th\n We breakfasted at 8.30, and after penning a few lines to Carmarthen, wended our way to Dalston Junction, where we took train to Broad Street. The weather being so unsettled, instead of walking through the city as intended, we took a bus straight to Charing Cross, walked through the station, the Charing Cross Hotel above being very handsome. In the courtyard in front are numbers of cabs waiting to be hired, also in the centre, is a copy of the ancient monument to Queen Eleanor, being one of the resting places, during her funeral procession. Going out through the handsome gates of the station, we crossed to the famous square, Trafalgar, in the centre of which is a very high monument, to the memory of England's greatest naval hero Nelson, a life sized figure of his on the top standing on a coil of rope. Around the base of the monument are several bas-reliefs of the great engagement and death of the great naval officer Nelson, surmounted with the well-known words, England expects every man to do his duty. At each corner of the monument, are Landseer's famous cast iron lions, reckoned second to none in sculpture. We then went to the National Gallery, where we saw Hogarth's pictures, the Rakes progress, also Wilke's and Turner's collections, and the raising of Lazarus by Sebastian, the one mentioned by the Rev H Guildford Sprigg (our missioner). Amongst the collection of the British School, was a lovely picture, St Augustin and Monica; also a picture which took my fancy called Derby Day, where there were many characters depicted. These are only a few of the many lovely pictures there. \nOn leaving the building, we had before us, the beautiful Church of St Martin’s, it is a fine west front, with high stone steps, and massive Corinthian pillars. The ceiling is very handsome, also the stained window at the last end, which represents the Ascension. This was the Church which Dr Johnson attended. \nWhen we came out from there, after refreshing the inner man, it rained heavily, therefore we took a bus direct to St Paul's Cathedral, the magnitude of which can never be comprehended unless seen. The first stone of the present St Paul's being the third building on the present site, was laid on 21st of June, 1675 by Sir Christopher Wren, was completed in 1710 in 35 years, under one architect, one master mason, and one bishop, at a cost of £747,954. There is a Latin inscription over the North Door, to the memory of Sir Christopher Wren, at the end of which are these words, “Reader if thou seekest his monument, look around\". The choir contains some of the finest carving in the world, by Grinling Gibbons. There is a very handsome pulpit of several coloured marbles, dedicated to the men, who fell in the Punjab. There was also a very handsome lectern; a brass eagle standing on a ball. The reredos is handsome in the extreme, but being such a distance from it, I could not properly describe it. Its erection has caused a great deal of controversy, on the account of one of the niches, containing the Virgin Mary, but no doubt the animosity arose, from the antagonistic opinions of those opposed to the Establishment. The chief statues which took my fancy, were John Howard, the great philanthrophist, Bishop Middleton, the first Protestant Indian Bishop, Lord Melbourne, with two life sized Angels in white marble, representing death, and resurrection, the Cenotaph to General Gordon, in bronze, the monument to Nelson, Sir Charles Napier, etc etc. There is also a very large marble font, which I believe is seldom used except for Royal Christenings. In one of the side chapels, is a gigantic monument to Waterloo's hero Wellington, whose body lies in the Crypt of this noble Cathedral. There are several beautiful stained glass windows, one being in memory of the Queen's visit to the Cathedral, on the occasion of the thanksgiving service for the recovery of the Prince of Wales. At 4 o'clock we heard the usual Evening  Services, with full choir, and a very pretty anthem was sung.  Afterwards the rain cleared a little, and we took two turns up Ludgate Hill, a bus to Broad Street, where we took tea, and home for the evening, after spending a very pleasant day. \nSunday, September 20th\nIn the morning weather was pretty fair, went with Aunt Barnes to All Saints’ Church, where we had an excellent sermon from the Vicar, the Rev Mr Spencer. In the afternoon we called at my cousin's, came home to tea and went with Mr Henson, and my cousin to St John's Church, Victoria, Chapel of East to St Peter’s, Eaton Square. It was a grand musical service of high class, at the end of the service, was a grand processional hymn, with cross and banners etc. Came home through the city, on top of a bus, and then took train home. I had supper with them, and reached home at 11.30. \nMonday, September 21st\nIt was much cooler in the morning and showery, so we took train to Broad Street and bus from there to the Strand, lunched, and took another bus, to the Oratory Brompton. The grandeur of the interior, marble gilding etc, must be seen, as I could not fully describe it. The building has Chapels on each side; two of them being entirely finished. I will try and remember them as they stand in order, taking our route on the right. The first is dedicated to St Patrick, the second to St Mary Magdalen, the third to the Virgin Mary, which is composed of many coloured marbles, surmounted by massive pillars, reaching nearly to the top of the building.  The Calvary Chapel, being a life size representation of the crucifixion, and of course as natural, a great contrast to the others, being so much darker, two or three dim lamps, only being burning. The 5th is dedicated to St Wilfrid, on leaving this one, we come upon a life size figure of St Peter, sitting upon his throne. We are now at the centre of attraction The High Altar, the coloured Mosaics, on ceilings, and sides, with the massive gilding, candlesticks and candelabra, forming one grand whole. We next came to an Altar, which we are not acquainted with the name. We next came to St Philip Neri, the patron saint of the Church. Then came the Chapel of VII Dolores, which was adorned with lovely asters, purple and white. Then came the Altar to St Joseph. The last one is dedicated to the Sacred Heart. Nearby is the font railed in. There are confession boxes at every chapel and fonttels of Holy Water; also a small gallery, and beautifully toned organ. \nWe then wended our steps to the Natural History Museum, it is a building of massive size, beautifully carved outside with handsome fluted pillars. In the galleries there are glass cases of birds of all sizes; so arranged as if they were on their native soil. There are rooms of stuffed monkeys, bears etc also minerals, coral, and skeletons of different animals. After well looking over it, we took some refreshment and then wended our way to the South Kensington Museum.\nThe museum consists principally of copies of originals, in plaster; Trojan's column being one of the chief objects of interest. Up in the galleries are to be seen Raphael's far famed cartoons; they were principally drawn as designs for tapestry work, for Pope Leo X. We saw several pictures, also drawn by Vandyke. In the centre gallery under glass-cases, are some elegant models of Chinese houses in carved ivory; also handsome collections of china, glass etc; we looked well over it.\nWe then took bus to Charing Cross and dined being 5 o'clock after which it came on to heavy rain, so we took a bus to Broad Street, and home for the evening. \nTuesday, September 22nd\nIn the morning, cousin Emily and us, took train to Broad Street, and bus direct to the Strand, purposing to go through the Embankment Gardens, but the rain came down in torrents, so had to shelter in the District Railway. After it cleared, walked over the Embankment to St Margaret's Church, Westminster, which had a beautiful porch, newly erected. The font is of many coloured marbles, pillared. The reredos is of carved oak, representing the Lord's Supper, above which is a very handsome glass window, representing the Crucifixion; also elegant windows to the memories of Lord Cavendish, whose awful death in Phoenix Park, will not soon be forgotten by English people and to Sir WaIter Raleigh .There  was also a Jubilee window , a Caxton window, a Milton window and others which memory will not recall. The organ was a real beauty, and we were favoured by hearing, \"How lovely are the messengers\", and \"The Hallelujah Chorus\", which resounded through the Church. There is a very handsome tomb here, the recumbent figure, to the memory of Lady Dudley.\nWe now bent our steps to the famous Westminster Abbey, which took us 3 hours to explore, and cannot be described here. We also went over the cloisters, and into the chapter, or ancient Parliament House. On leaving  the Abbey, we took some refreshment, and then took a bus up to Oxford Street, where we went to the British Museum, but had to take a cursory glance, owing to it being closed up in about an hour. We made our way at once to see the Egyptian mummies, which with the immense coffins they were encased in are something  wonderful. We saw the original Magna Carta, signed by King John, in the King's Library, which I suppose is the largest in the world, some elegantly bound Bibles, also illuminated, a Jewish scroll on parchment, (of course in Hebrew), Wycliffe's Bible, and autographs of great men, such as Disraeli, Lord Palmerston etc. I also saw Gordon's last letter, and the Royal seals, of different Kings and Queens. As it rained so heavily and began to thunder and lightning, we thought it best to take a bus to Broad St and home for the evening, where we had tea. \nWednesday, September 23rd\nStarted in the morning by train for Abney Park Cemetery, where Isaac Watts tomb is, with a lifesize figure of him on the top. It is a very pretty place and we saw several handsome monuments. We did not have time to go all over it, so we came back by tram, and took train from Dalston to Broad Street took a bus from there to Wellington, and a bus from there to Waterloo. From there we took train to Clapham Junction, to see my two brothers (Jack and Harry) who are at Emanuel School, (near Wandsworth). We took them out, and inspected the nice shops there, and took a tram to Chelsea, walked over the handsome Suspension Bridge, from where we saw the model of the Eddystone lighthouse from the Naval Exhibition grounds. Returned by tram to Clapham Junction, took tea, and then went with Jack and Harry and saw all over the school. Returned home by train via Waterloo. \nThursday, September 24th\n We took a bus to Threadneedle Street, walked into the Royal Exchange, went all round, and heard the bells playing  God save the Queen. We then went into the Bank of England, and saw all around there. It is an immense place. Went into the Guildhall, and saw the banquet room; saw the free library there, also the museum and picture gallery. After we had lunched, went to the three Crane's Wharf, and then to Drury Lane Theatre where we got tickets for Friday night. Came home to Aunt's to tea, and had a very pleasant evening there, our cousins came, and we had some music and singing. \nFriday, September 25th\nCame by cab in the morning to Cecil Street (Strand) and then took a bus to Jay's great mourning shop, Regent Street. It is an immense shop, and contains only mourning. Just opposite is another large shop Peter Robinson. We had some lunch, and then walked about the West End, and saw the Alhambra Music Hall. We also went into Martin Wallis and Co's large shops. Walked all down Regent Street, came in and wrote some letters. Afterwards we went in the Embankment Gardens and had tea in the Strand. In the evening we went to Drury Lane Theatre, where we saw The Sailor's Knot, the scenery of which and the plot was very good. The band was excellent, and gained the popularity of the audience by playing the oIde English Airs, Sweet Home, Rule Britannia and Come lasses and lads, being among  the numbers. We much enjoyed it, and came home about eleven. The enthusiasm of the audience was unbounded, the performers being called each time before the curtain. \nSaturday, September 26th\nIt was very wet and neither of us felt very well, no doubt owing to the dissipation of the previous evening. Thought to go to Covent Garden but too wet, so took a bus to Bond Street and went to Doré's Gallery, which was very beautiful, most of them being of large dimensions. They are mostly religious subjects. Amongst the ones I liked were: The bale of tears; A day Dream; The neophyte; The Dream of Pilate's wife; Christ leaving the Proetorium and Moses before Pharaoh. We stayed there for two hours. Being fine when we left we leisurely strolled up Bond and Oxford Street, to Madame Tussaud's. The interior of that building being very gorgeous. The staircase is a copy of the Louvre at Paris. We saw it lighted with electric light, which added to the richness of the building. The models were gorgeously dressed, and one could scarcely distinguish between the wax figures and real people. One model of Cobelt was peculiarly so, he being seated among the audience, turning his head round; also a policeman, in the centre of one of the rooms. In one corner, in a room set apart by itself, and seated at a table writing, with a lighted lamp, and other accessories of a library was Her Majesty the Queen, which if it had not been in a waxwork exhibition, would never have thought it to have been a model. At the end of a room was large rockery and fernery combined filled in with glass. On descending to the Refreshment Room, there was a splendid representation there of:  Execution of Mary Queen of Scots; The Boat Race; Preparing for the Hunt; Dr Koch in his laboratory; Robinson Crusoe and Cinderella; Mr and Mrs Hogg and baby also two carriages used by the Great Napoleon, in his exile at St Helena. On returning to the large room, we heard the Swiss band, and mountain singers Jungfrau Kapelle. They were several in number and were dressed in Swiss costume, the females in blue with white stripes, red satin aprons, white bodices, with black velvet stays laced with silver, and dark blue felt hats, with drooping white feathers. The men were dressed in pale blue knickers, with blue and white striped stockings, blue tunics, and felt hats trimmed with feathers at the side. They played the Violincello, Violins, Mandolins, Guitars, large and small kettledrums, clappers, flutes, harp, piano, American organ, Cornet, Harmonica, Zither, and an instrument composed of several long sticks, played with other sticks, the rapidity of which made it very wonderful. Altogether it was a very clever performance. They also sang several Italian songs. We had dinner in the Strand and came home for the evening. \nSunday, September  27th\nIn the morning  we walked to St Thomas' (Regent Street) where we had a very nice service, and Sermon from the Rev Mr Bainbrigg, who took for his text What think ye of Christ? We waited to see the choral celebration which was performed by the Rev Mr Hitchcock, who had on an elaborately embroidered cape. Two acolytes with scarlet cassocks, and linen tunics, knelt at the top of the Altar steps, winging the Censer, several lighted candles  were on the Altar, and a brass cross. The singing of the Introits was very beautiful, the organ being very powerful. The Cassocks of the choir were blue. There were three suspended lamps at the Altar, and these kept burning continually. Pictures of the station of the Cross adorn the wall. The outward demeanour of the congregation was very devout, an example that might well be followed by the so-called low churchmen. We came home to dinner at 1.30, and at 3 o'clock went to St Martin’s, to hear the Flower Service, it being Harvest Thanksgiving. There was a large attendance of the schools and nearly all carried nice bunches of flowers, or baskets of fruit. The service was read by the Rev Mr Kitto, and the address given by Rev Mr Paull; the subject being the rainbow. After the service we went through St James' Park, passing : Marlborough House, the residence of the Prince of Wales; St James Palace, where Queen Victoria was married; Clarence House the Duke of Edinburgh's residence; and Buckingham Palace, where the Queen spends a few weeks in the year. We saw many sentries guarding each of these buildings. We returned home by the side of the ornamental water, called Rosamond's Pond, the Wellington Barracks being on our right. Crossed the ornamental bridge to Westminster, walked round Parliament Square, and saw among others, the monument erected to one of England's greatest statesmen, Beaconsfield.  Returned via Parliament Street, to Whitehall, viewing the noble buildings of the Home and Admiralty Offices. Saw the Life Guards patrolling, walked through the great square of the Park, returning by way of Scotland Yard, to Northumberland Avenue, where the fine Hotels, The Grand, the Victoria, and the Metropole, are situated; also the Constitutional Club, a very palatial looking building. Walked to the Embankment, and saw the famous Cleopatra's Needle, which a few years ago, adorned the burning sands of Egypt. Came up Savoy Street, and home to tea, being tired from the day's outing. \nMonday, September 28th\n Took bus to Bishopsgate and thought we should never get down, there was such a tremendous traffic, and made some purchases, which took us several hours. We then went and had something to eat, and then walked to St Paul's churchyard. Went into several book shops, including  the Religious Tract Society, through Panier Alley, where we saw the well-known boy in the basket. We went through Paternoster Row, where we bought several things. Took a bus home, and after having dined went to Covent Garden Concert. Returned from the concert, after 11.15 which we enjoyed very much, especially, the joint bands of the Italian Opera, and Coldstream Guards. Covent Garden is a very handsome theatre of immense size, with an elegant gas chandelier in the centre, and we had very nice seats in the centre of the house. \nTuesday, September 29th\n Took bus to Cheapside, going into the handsome premises of Mappin Bros and made some purchases, after which walked to Paternoster Row, and entered several bookshops. We then took a bus to the Strand, and after having refreshed ourselves, took another bus to Victoria station, where we took a train to Forest Hill, where we saw Aunt Emma, and Katie and Florrie (my cousins). We took tea with them, and afterwards went out to see the shops. Came back and then went to the station 7.30, reaching Victoria about 8.15. We then took bus to Charing Cross, and then came in.\nThe view from the train passing Chelsea Bridge was very pretty, the Eddystone lighthouse at the Naval Exhibition was lighted up; the lights from Chelsea were shining on the water, which gave it the appearance of a moonlight scene. \nWednesday, September 30th\n After breakfast took a bus to Manchester Square, as we had business there. Then walked through Oxford Street, and had something to eat, then took a bus to the Strand, then another bus down to Bishopsgate on business. From there we took a bus to Cheapside, bought a few things and then lunched, after which walked through Lombard St, King William St, to the Monument, and on to London Bridge, which as usual was thronged with people and vehicles. Returned through Gracechurch St to Threadneedle St. Took a bus to Dalston, where we had tea at Aunt’s  and stayed chatting with them till 7.45 and took a train to Broad St, and a bus direct to Charing Cross. The shops on the way displaying a pretty spectacle, being brilliantly lighted. Took a late dinner and came in tired with our day's outing. \nThursday, October 1st\n In the morning took a bus to Sloane St, walked past the Knightsbridge Barracks, (an immense building), as far as the Albert Hall, a hall capable of holding 10,000 people, being built in circular form. Crossed to the Albert Memorial, a magnificent monument composed of numerous figures in white marble, musicians, artists, etc. It is exceedingly high and in the centre in gilt, is a figure of the Prince Consort, seated. The monument is composed of mosaics, studded with coloured stones, surmounted with a cross at the top. At the four corners are life-size figures representing Europe, Asia, Africa and America, all in white marble. Europe is represented by the bull, Asia by the Elephant, Africa by the Camel, and America by the Bison and being grouped together make one grand whole. The ascent is by several marble steps and the entire monument being closed in with magnificent gilded railings. The whole forms a fitting memorial to one so beloved by the nation Albert the Good. We then leisurely strolled through Hyde Park, passed the famous Rotten Row, along which we saw many Equestrians. Crossed the Park, leaving Park Lane on the right, to Cumberland Gate, where stands the famous Marble Arch. We then walked down Oxford Street, into the Dorothy Restaurant, where we had Maids of Honour and other light refreshments, and walked through Regent St, to Pall Mall, where it came to rain. Came as far as St Martin’s, where we had to stay rather a long time, the rain coming down heavily. We then walked over to the Lowther Arcade, came in and wrote some letters, went out and made some purchases, and took dinner at 6 o'clock, and being such a wet evening had to abandon any further outing. \nFriday, October 2nd\n In the morning went for a little turn to some different streets, and then after lunching, left by cab for Paddington, where we took train to Reading. We arrived just before three, and came to Denmark House, Erleigh Road (the residence of Aunt Sarah); it is a very nice house.  After having a little refreshment, took a walk along the Erleigh Road, came in and had tea. After tea, Mabel, Frances and I went down town. Came home, and after having supper and chatting for a bit, went to bed. \nSaturday, October 3rd\n In the morning we went down town; there are a few nice shops and buildings. We came home to dinner, and afterwards had a carriage drive to a village called Sonning, passing Caversham Park on our right the seat of Mr Crashaw. We went into Sonning Church, some of the carving being very beautiful; also the coloured windows, which were very nice. There was a very handsome monument to the memory of the \"Palmer\" family. The church was decorated for Harvest Thanksgiving. Returned to tea via Caversham. After tea, we played cards, and after supper chatted till 11.30, when we went to bed. \nSunday, October 4th\n In the morning Aunt Georgie, Willie and I went to St Luke's Church. It is a large brick building, but no ornamentation. It was a good hearty service, and a good reader, but could not hear the preacher very well, as we sat far back. The text was taken from Judges 8th chapter and 4th verse. After we came out, we went to meet Kitty and Frances, who had gone to St John's Church and then we came home to dinner. After dinner, Aunt Georgie, Frances, Willie and myself went to the cemetery. There are not many monuments of note, and it is built on very flat ground. We came home to tea, and afterwards had some hymns. Then Kitty and Frances, Arthur, Willie and I went to St Giles Church. We had a splendid service, very good singing, and reading, and a good sermon on Temperance. The Altar piece was very pretty and there was a brass cross, and flowers on the table. It is a very large church, I do not know whether there are any stained windows, because it was dark. We then came home and had supper, and after chatting a bit went to bed. \nMonday, October 5th.\n In the morning went over Huntley and Palmers biscuit factory, which was most interesting. We had several biscuits to taste; they employ 4000 hands and make 400 different sorts of biscuits. We then walked through the Forbury Gardens, and looked through the Roman Catholic Church, a building of little note. Then we went into St Lawrence's Church, a very nice old church, with monuments on the walls of ancient type. We then came home to dinner, and at 3 o'clock went for a drive along the Bath Road, passing many nice houses on the way. Came home to tea, and then had cards, and other games until supper time. After supper talked until 12 o'clock when we went to bed. \nTuesday, October 6th\n We started from Reading by the London Express, on a very wet morning. Came through the Box and Severn Tunnel, both of which are very long.  We reached Swansea at 4.45, where we were met by Cousin Millie, after booking our boxes, walked to·Aunt Emily's where we found them well, and also Lucy who was delighted to see us. We had a nice tea, and chatted until 11 o'clock, when we went to bed thoroughly tired. \nWednesday, October 7th\n It was a wet morning but about 11 it cleared a little, so Cousin Millie and I went out, leaving  Aunt Georgie chatting to Uncle John. We went into the town and came home to dinner at 12.30. We left for home about 4 o'clock and reached our destination at 5.30, had tea and found all well and thus ended a pleasant three week trip.","summary":"Diary of an 1891 visit to London by Lillie White with her Aunt Georgie, Sept 18th – Oct 6th","title":"Dyddiadur o ymweliad yn 1891 â Llundain gan Lillie White a’i modryb, Aunt Georgie, Medi 18fed – Hydref 6ed","titleCy":"Dyddiadur o ymweliad yn 1891 â Llundain gan Lillie White a’i modryb, Aunt Georgie, Medi 18fed – Hydref 6ed","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1387931","uuid":"2dfb4377-41a8-321e-b396-091e26885f18","creationDate":"-1891101-8000000.0","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","ciimId":"pcw-1387931.0","group":"community","lon":"-0.097815796701","lat":"51.513812232692","subject":["'Holidays and Resorts'","'OTHER: Arts and Crafts'","'OTHER: Sports and Games'","'People and Family'","'Theatre and Performing Arts'"]}}},{"@template":{"details":{"level":"item","description":"Photographed by John Thomas.","summary":"Tyn-y-cwm pigs, Llansawel, c. 1885","title":"Moch Tyn-y-cwm, Llansawel, tua'r flwyddyn 1885","titleCy":"Moch Tyn-y-cwm, Llansawel, tua'r flwyddyn 1885","itemURL":"https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/1374","uuid":"893d22aa-6121-3645-bc53-0ef80de78e1a","creationDate":"00188000-","collection":"People's Collection Wales","collectionId":"pcw-0","rights":"The National Library of Wales","ciimId":"pcw-1374.0","group":"community","lon":"-4.018172486518","lat":"52.009203267450","subject":"'OTHER: Physical Environment'"}}}],"errors":[],"aggregations":[],"stats":{"total":52958,"providers":1,"transformations":1,"provider_latency":49,"transformation_latency":1374},"found":true}
